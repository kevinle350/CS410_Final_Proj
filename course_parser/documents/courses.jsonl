I figured, my undergrad degree was mathematics (statistics option because I loved probability) & I had even taken a grad-level mathematics course in regression back in the day. I figured I could skip the entry-level stats course. I spent *most* of my time for this course waiting for R Studio to compile LaTeX. Probably I was just working very inefficiently. I did manage an A+. It kicked my butt, but I survived. If I recall, as it has been some years, most of the R used is just boilerplate. The real work in terms of programming would be done in the JAGS library which is completely unlike the R language itself.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked30 hrs/wk", "Advanced Bayesian ModelingSpring 2022linkThis course was quite difficult to do well in, but very informative5/13/2022, 1:53 PMThis course had what felt like quite a heavy workload, and was difficult to grasp some concepts, but the professor is amazing. Dr. Park is passionate about what he teaches and it shows! He is quick with grading, quick to respond to students and responds in detail.\n\nThat being said, I found his midterms to be very difficult and some of the material difficult to fully grasp. I am not from a statistics background which probably plays a role in this. \n\nAll that being said though, I feel confident with my new understanding of Bayesian statistics, and I have learned how to use R to a level I feel comfortable performing analysis. Further, while the material is difficult, I do feel much better prepared and would encourage other students to learn ABM too.

Content repeats lectures on 80-90% and does not require in most of the cases explanation of what's going on on the graphs, except for couple of last assignments.\n\nWhat is not in this course:\n- explicit explanation on why we do Bayesian modeling instead of conventional, and in which cases this shift worth the effort. \n- Answers on any questions which are outside of the scope of the lectures and assignments\n- Any kind of additional literature recommendation\n- Any kind of recommendation how to extend the concepts on the bigger datasets or some other generalized real-world tasks. You will need to be able, knowing the probability theory and this course math and toy examples, figure out yourself what to do with that knowledge. That is entirely separate chunk of knowledge, which you will need to gain yourself already after the course. \n- no SW tool choice or explanation of advantages/drawback of different tools. Means, after this course you will need to spend time for investigating and finding the tool for your work yourself in case if the tool proposed in the course will not fit your needs.\n- I would also comment, that the forum and chat was the most silent over any other courses which I took in the program. \n\nSummarizing, this course is not a tool to start practicing Bayesian modeling in each and every working place immediately after the course (like PSL was for instance), but rather a start for you to study BM yourself, so in case if you have the need to use it at your job, plan a good additional time for self-study. I feel a bit frustrated due to that, as in case if the course if the course would be easy and not easy applicable, that would at least mean that you have spent not enough time and need to spend more. But in this particular case, when course is hard and not applicable - this gives a sense that for the same time budget I would distribute the efforts differently in case if I would self-study it, so means part of the time was just lost.HelpfulHardNeutral12 hrs/wk", "Advanced Bayesian ModelingSpring 2022linkGreat Lectures and Reasonable Assignments5/11/2022, 7:15 AMThis course is a great extension of any graduate statistics coursework. The concepts provide a powerful approach that allow you to extract more insights from smaller datasets than you could by using traditional frequentist methods. The lectures are very clear and assignments were directly related to lecture material. While assignments take some time to complete ~ 4-6 hours per assignment, they are straightforward and I was always able to get my questions answered in campuswire or office hours. The midterm and final, all multiple choice, are hard but fair, requiring a solid understanding to do well in. The final data analysis was essentially a more comprehensive homework assignment in which you write a homework in formal academic paper format.\n\nOverall a great course and I highly recommend it if you are interested in statistics.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked13 hrs/wk", "Advanced Bayesian ModelingSpring 2022linkTop-tier course, but very intense5/9/2022, 8:33 PMI really enjoy the subject of Bayesian modeling, to the point where taking this course was a reason for me to join the program. I was not disappointed. It's the hardest class I've taken so far but very worth the time. \n\nThe pacing is breakneck. There are homeworks due every two weeks. Sprinkle in two midterms in the middle, and the paper presentation/data analysis report at the end, and you end up with basically no reprieve. The course is very well-organized and Prof. Park is very helpful, responding to all questions in a very timely fashion. One thing to note is that the course lives up to its \"advanced\" moniker; there is not much time spent on introductory material or questions like \"why Bayesian methods?\" That said, there are some brave souls who have taken the class without any background in Bayesian statistics and done well, but it's definitely going to require significant additional work to do so and succeed. Keep these things in mind if you intend to take the class. \n\nOverall, a strong recommendation if you're interested in an advanced course on statistics and data science.\n\n\n#### Weekly Material ####\nEvery week there are lecture videos and a quiz. There is an accompanying textbook also - the well-known BDA3. The videos will take 1.5-2hrs, roughly. They are incredibly dense; I usually watch at 1.25/1.5 speed in other courses but any speedup was impossible for me here. The textbook is not necessary to read if you digest the videos (a sentiment corroborated by the prof), and is actually even more intense than the videos.\n\n\n#### Homework ####\nThere are 5 homeworks involving Bayesian analysis of provided datasets. They are lengthy, taking several hours each, but straightforward. There are no surprises, and the methodology is pretty much demonstrated for you in the lecture videos.\n\nEverything is in R, using the JAGS software for MCMC. This is one area that I wish could change, since JAGS is not widely used, but it's a very reasonable choice. There is no expectation to know JAGS, or even R, beforehand.\n\n\n#### Exams ####\nThere are two midterms. The second midterm does not explicitly cover material from the first.\n\nHardest exam for me thus far in the program was midterm 1. The first few quizzes are not trivial (they do get easier) so I thought they were representative of the exam difficulty. Not at all! Strongly advise preparing heavily for the exams. \n\n\n#### Paper Presentation & Data Analysis Report ####\nThere are also another two graded portions. The paper presentation is a voiced slide deck, up to 10 min long, on an assigned paper about some Bayesian analysis. It's pretty cool to be able to synthesize everything you've learned and digest actual research. I found this a rewarding assignment, but it's really all about what you make of it. The rubric is reasonably lenient.\n\nThe data analysis report is assigned at the end of the semester and open for two weeks. It sounds intimidating at first but it's basically another homework assignment, just with some additional exposition and formatting.HelpfulHardLiked12 hrs/wk", "Advanced Bayesian ModelingSpring 2019linkOne of the best classes in the program10/11/2021, 9:40 AMThis class is hands down top 3 (the other two are IMO CS425 and PSL) in the entire DS track back when I took it in early 2019.\n\n1.

Read lots (and lots and lots) of academic research papers on distributed computing, and (as part of a team) present one of them to the class.\n2. (As part of a team) Write a conference-ready academic paper of your own.\n\nThis is the only course I took that required students to be online during class hours (1.75 hours on Tuesdays & Thursdays).  You will learn very quickly how brilliant Indy is, if you didn't already learn in CS-425 Distributed Systems.\n\nExpect to read 2-4 academic papers a week and write summaries on them, while in the interim, forming teams, coming up with project ideas, implementing those ideas, and writing the paper on your own.  Indy provides some guidance at the beginning, but he mostly leaves you to your own devices.  The class will peer-review your paper halfway through the semester.\n\nWhy I loved this class:\n----------------------\nThis is the first course in the program that treated me like an adult.  No exams, no weekly quizzes, no MPs.  Just read papers and write about them, prepare a presentation, and write a paper of your own.  There's no hand-holding.  Try to keep up.\n\nI learned so much from this class, that it re-ignited a long-standing passion I had in distributed systems.  I even picked up the Cloud Networking MOOC just to understand how packets are routed around inside a data center.\n\nTo top it off, I presented one of the papers we read at Papers We Love: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W55mk2CivJo\n\nWhy this class drove me crazy:\n-------------------------------\nYou really have no idea what your final grade in the class is until it's posted on your transcript.  Outside of a meeting and an initial paper proposal, Indy doesn't really involve himself in your work, until he grades it at the very end of the semester.\n\nTo make matters worse, Indy is very, very good at overhyping your sense of self.  Example: Indy told me that my contribution to the presentation was \"superb,\" then gave me an 85% for it.  Everyone I showed his feedback to thought I got a 98%, until they saw his final grade.\n\nOh, and if Indy says an assignment is due Sunday, it's due Sunday.

I would recommend starting with STAT 420 as your first course and refresh on linear algebra basics from outside sources such as YouTube or Khan Academy, etc. This will make your learning experience with AML much better in terms of understanding concepts and not having personal meltdowns while completing some of the programming assignments in this course. STAT 420 explains both basic statistical concepts and slowly builds on the regression concepts. R-programming used in STAT 420 introduces you to programming gently and is much more geared towards mathematical operations compared to Python.\nAt the time of writing this post, I am at the tail end of my very first semester with MCS program where I elected AML as my only course for the semester. I have completed all online content and programming assignments for AML and reading through material for STAT 420.HelpfulMediumLiked12 hrs/wk", "Applied Machine LearningFall 2021linkMediocre, There are some pros, and some cons12/13/2021, 2:03 PMWhat this course taught me:  It seemed like a soft mathematical crash course in the popular machine learning models. You are given a high level about how the model works and the algorithms behind them.  You are then tasked with performing these algorithms using numpy rather then the pre-packaged ML models that are out there. You will become fluent at being able to read and algorithm and knowing how to apply that in python from scratch. \n\nWhat I wished I learned: When to apply these models and how to get the best out of them. I found my self watching a lot of other material in order to learn the basic things about these models.  I found that these lectures failed to answer the why. How can I build the best features to support these models and how to do you build pipelines and support to be able to deploy models at scale for businesses.\n\nOverall:  This is not a great course but was good for my first course to take in the program.

The subject matter is engaging, and the assignments actually have you performing interesting work. The issue is the instruction. The current professor reads slides in *very* short lecture videos (given the complexity of AML) that explain next to nothing, then you are given access to a Jupyter notebook for that week with a given number of tasks to complete. \n\nThe core issue is that these notebooks are mostly self-guided and rely entirely on your ability to manipulate numpy arrays. Essentially: if you are good at numpy: this class will be easy, and you won't learn much ML. If you are bad at numpy, this class will be hard, and you wont learn much ML.

I am disappointed with the lectures and the class, the way it is taught; many times I feel that the lectures dont even meet the basic requirements to be called a lecture. There is lots of room for improvement in this class.HelpfulMediumDisliked6 hrs/wk", "Applied Machine LearningSpring 2021linkYou need to push yourself to learn in this course.11/15/2021, 10:45 AMApplied Machine Learning is a sampler tray of machine learning algorithms with emphasis on hands-on experience using the algorithms to write tools and solve problems.  While the algorithms are explained, they are not exhaustively derived and belabored like in a math course.  That effort is saved for later courses such as Practical Statistical Learning where you dive into the proofs.\n\nThis course was originally taught by Professor D.A. Forsyth, who also designed the course and wrote the textbook.  The course originally had 10 machine problems and used the R language for coding which students wrote from scratch.  In 2020, professor Morales took over the teaching duties for the online section and converted the 10 machine problems into 14 equivalent jupyter notebook machine problems using python as the coding language, and students merely fill in the blanks of the notebooks while the heavy lifting of testing, training, and reporting is already provided in the notebook.\n\nThe course consists of weekly lectures, readings from the textbook, 14 machine problems, and associated quizzes.  No exams, no reports, ...   The following machine learning algorithms are covered (not a complete list):\n   - K means\n   - Naive Bayes\n   - Support Vector Machines (SVM) \n   - Stochastic Gradient Descent\n   - GLMNet\n   - Elastic Net\n   - EM\n   - Linear Regression\n   - Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCA)\n   - Markov Chains\n   - Boltzman Machines\n   - Clustering\n   - Random Forests\n   - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n   - Vector Quantization\n   - AutoEncoders\n   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n   - (optional)\n\nYou can get an 'A' in this course with minimal effort, often without reading the textbook or watching the lecture videos.  However, if you take that route you will not learn anything useful.  To truly learn, you'll need to dig deep into Forsyth's  textbook and push yourself beyond the assignment requirements.  The information is there and well presented, but you have to put forth the effort.\n\nThe textbook is very good, but professor Forsyth tends to speak to the PhD in you.  The reading can be quite verbose, but it is insightful if you take it seriously.  The book mirrors how he taught the course, and is presented in the same order.\n\nThe lecture videos presented by professor Morales are a bit tough to watch.  They are terse, merely summarize what is already found in the back of each chapter in the textbook, and don't provide any insight.  Professor Morales' presentation skills leave a lot to be desired as well.  Some videos can be painful to watch.  The co-instructor who has office hours once per week also provides lecture material which supplements the material provided by professor Morales.  The supplementary lectures are more proof driven and go into the weeds of the math if you're interested in that sort of thing.  However, many of the lectures come across as hollow as they're disconnected to the student's headspace at that point of the course.  They don't resonate.\n\nThere is approximately one machine problem per week, each represented as a jupyter notebook written in the python programming language.  They are fairly straight forward task oriented assignments with a preface to the topic followed by one or more cells where the student has to fill in the blank to complete the algorithm.  At the end of the notebook, the instructor provides the code to do the data splitting for testing/training, conducts the training, and reports the findings in a plot or table.  Some of these reports may be needed to answer associated quiz questions in the weekly quiz.  Many of the tasks that have to be coded have nothing to do with machine learning algorithms, but are merely prep work to set up data for learning.  For example, the Naive Bayes assignment in week 2 is an example of how to do character recognition using the MNIST character set (a well known problem).  The notebook has 10 tasks, but the first 8 are routines for cropping, rotating, and flipping images.  the final two machine problems are do-it-yourself variety where you're given a set of instructions to set up a problem on established data, but you must tune the parameters of the algorithm to compute a result that achieves a defined minimum score.  These two machine problems can take a very long time as they are very iterative in nature.\n\nThese machine problems were designed on a Linux system, and some will only operate on a Linux system (GLMNet, for example).  While you can do the assignments on a Windows or MacOS computer, expect problems with precision error in the math causing your tests to fail.  If you don't want to deal with these kinds of hassles, then do the assignments on the Coursera server as provided, or get a computer that runs Ubuntu Linux and install the notebooks locally.  You may need help from TA's to download the assignments correctly.\n\nThe main benefit of this course is the use of numpy and vectorization libraries to write code.  You learn very early to abandon 'for' loops and other classical statement constructs in favor of library provided methods.  The acceleration is very pronounced (10x or more).  But for the purpose of machine learning...this course leaves a lot to be desired.  As stated above, if you truly want to learn the subject, you'll need to dig into the textbook and do it yourself.  use office hours to answer questions about the textbook when you get stuck.\n\nkeys to success:\n\n- do the numpy coding exercises early and become proficient in vectorization methods.\n\n- do find and watch professor Forsyth's lectures from when he taught the course in 2018-2020.  They are long videos, but insightful while following the textbook faithfully.\n\n- do read the textbook intently and use it as a guide to do the machine problems.  There will be some exceptions as the textbook examples were written in the R language and some concepts don't translate to Python (EM algorithm, for example).\n\n- do spend time in office hours getting clarity on the algorithms.  Not everything is explained well in the assignments, and many assignments have errors.HelpfulEasyDisliked5 hrs/wk", "Applied Machine LearningSpring 2021linkEssentially a NumPy Bootcamp10/27/2021, 9:45 AMThe pacing of the class was good, but the lectures were poorly done and difficult to understand.

It provides a balance of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in AWS, which was highly valuable to me to learn about roles in cloud architecture, DevOps, or cloud-based software development. While the course can be challenging, especially for students unfamiliar with cloud services, the rewards are substantial in terms of industry readiness and practical skills.\n\nThere were a lot of programming assignments (called \"MPs\".)  12 for the semester.  About half were done in various Amazon AWS apps (and combinations of those apps working together).  And about half were in Docker Linux images that were prepared for us with the right programs/libraries set up for that assignment.  \n\nThese assignments took a lot of time, far longer than the 4-6 hour suggested time, so don't leave them to the last day or anything.  One of the problems with this is that Amazon seemed to be always updating and changing how their app worked, so the directions for a assignment wouldn't always work anymore, like when the default version of linux that a VM was set up with got change by Amazon to one that wasn't compatible with the assignment, you had to figure out that you needed to change to another version in your VM, etc.  Either ways, Campuswire was great in providing tips/tricks to overcome these. All the MPs could be completed in either Java or Python.\n\nNot many opportunities for extra credit. Think there were a total of 2% (or so) in total). \n\nThe prof. and TAs in the course were the highlight. These guys put in a solid effort during OH (which often went on far beyond the 1 hour allocated). \n\nWhile this course has a steep learning curve (if you don't have a background), a high degree of self learning and reliance, it is totally worth it.

Fun to explore different Applications. The MP's were difficult, but really fulfilling if you complete them. \n\nCons: I did not have any cloud experience, and a lot of the MP's were \"read this tutorial to figure out how to do xyz\".  I spent a lot of time combing through Campuswire and asking questions. The lectures were mostly broad on the overall concepts. The exams were proctored and based on the video lecture material. \n\nOverall, I did really bad in the course, but that was more due to outside circumstances in my life. But I really enjoyed the course and the lecture videos. The MPs were challenging, but worthwhile. I would definitely not recommend pairing this course with another difficult course if you do not have a lot of cloud experience, or if you are working as well.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked20 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2024linkHands-On and Comprehensive, Outdated and Frustrating at Times5/10/2024, 7:07 PMAs an experienced software engineer, I approached UIUC's Cloud Computing Applications course with a solid background in the field, which perhaps influenced my perspective on the course's challenge level and content. The course is comprehensive, covering a broad array of topics, which can be immensely beneficial for those newer to cloud computing.\n\nPros:\n\nThe programming assignments are particularly noteworthy. They provide extensive hands-on experience with various AWS services and big data processing frameworks. This practical application of knowledge is invaluable, simulating real-world scenarios that engineers face in the industry.\n\nFor someone less experienced, the breadth of technologies discussed and the opportunity to engage with them hands-on would be challenging, rewarding, and undoubtedly valuable.\n\nCons:\n\nSome lectures felt repetitive and could benefit from condensation or restructuring to enhance engagement. More critically, parts of the course content and some exam questions were outdated. Given UIUC's reputation, it is disappointing to see such oversights in course updates, which can mislead or confuse students.\n\nMany exam questions seemed like random trivia from the lecture notes. Memorizing obscure details from a seldom-used data processing framework is pointless. In the real world, you typically learn about specific technologies on the job by reading documentation. I would have preferred to be tested on solving problems in a generic way that didn't rely on memorizing framework-specific components. That being said, I found that one could score well enough to earn an 'A' in the course without studying for the exam, as long as they digested all of the lecture videos, and scored 100% on all quizzes and homework.\n\nThe programming assignments used Coursera's autograding scripts, but the feedback provided was not helpful for troubleshooting. The feedback was often too vague, leading to guesswork about what went wrong. While fostering problem-solving skills is understandable, sometimes the issues were not in the programming logic but in minor edge cases that caused incorrect outputs.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThe course offers a solid foundation in cloud computing applications, particularly beneficial for early-career engineers or students. While it excels at making theoretical knowledge actionable through its assignments, it could improve by updating its content to keep pace with the rapid developments in cloud technology. I would have greatly appreciated having access to such a resource during my undergraduate studies.HelpfulMediumLiked8 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2024linkExtensive, hands-on course5/10/2024, 3:00 AMThe course contains weekly quizes and hands-on assignments, and also two exams proctored exams.\nIt contains many (MANY) topics.

The structure of the course is very poor and does not encourage gaining a deep understanding of the material. The lecture videos are tediously long and don't always feel relevant or interesting. On top of that, the midterm and final (non-cumulative, multiple-choice) are worth only 15% each so it's basically possible to not watch a single lecture video, guess on tests, and nearly get a B in the course, assuming you can finish all MPs. It is important that you have your own motivation when taking this course, rather than be motivated by grades.\n\nAgain, despite the course not really encouraging this deep understanding of topics, it is what you make of it. The videos generally do a good job of covering topics so it's certainly possible to come out of this course with a ton of knowledge and experience applying that knowledge in MPs.\n\nPositives of this course -\n\n- It covers many topics, many of which are relevant & interesting\n- The MPs are engaging and help you to get hands on using AWS and different programming ideas. The course is worth it on its own for this IMO. Worth noting that others mentioned they racked up costs on AWS, but I probably never paid more than ~$10 or $15 in total for AWS.\n- MPs and quizzes allow unlimited retries \n\nNegatives of this course -\n\n- engagement from the professor (and to an extent the TAs) often feel non-existent. Basic questions like \"why does the final exam deadline keep moving and what is the official deadline\" went unanswered for 3 days, during finals week, for an exam that needs proctoring. Some other questions never get answered. \n- I don't have direct experience with this, but it almost felt weekly that other students complained about not being able to access office hours or office hours being cancelled with no notice.\n- MPs can be very frustrating at times with piecing together instructions & debugging an un-debuggable autograderHelpfulMediumNeutral12 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2024linkGood Assignments but Hard Lectures - lots of content to memorize.5/5/2024, 1:16 PMI honestly, down to my soul, could not watch these lectures in an efficient way, even though I knew this course had proctored exams. I would easily double or triple the expected completion time for the lectures because I just could not tether my mind to the contents of the lecture. I don't view this as the class' fault; I've always had trouble paying attention to lectures. But this was my first semester for the program and I have kind of forgotten how to most efficiently allocate time for school, so if you're like me and lectures (whether in-person or online) are excruciating to watch, here is a strategy that I would adopt if I were to take this class all over again (which might not be out of the realm of possibility), bearing in mind that aside from the assignments, this is a **memorization**-based course:\n\nThe assignments were actually easier for me to follow and/or complete than the lectures were, so to that end, try to create as much time for the lectures as possible. To do that, go to the midterm exam week of coursework in Coursera and view the study guides for each week of content. Therein, you will find what will be on the exam. Use those questions/topics and the downloadable slides for each of the weeks to create Anki cards (flashcard memorization application for those who don't know) to both learn and memorize the course content. Try to include images (using screenshots) and explanations for each of the flashcards. Repeat after the midterm for the final exam.\n\nAlso take great care not to fall behind.

Shouldn't be a problem.\n\nMP's\n- MP's are all auto-graded. Here are the two kinds of MPs you will run into.\n\nCloud-based MP's\n- These are frustrating. Most of the time the instructions given in the assignment will not be sufficient.

You just write code either in Python or Java and execute in a Docker container until your output passes the autograder. \n\nExams and Lectures\nThese are by far the worst parts of the class. There are about 3 hours of lectures every week. Exams are multiple-choice and ask you arbitrary trivia on the lecture material. If you add it up, you will have to study about 20+ hours of lecture for both the midterm and final. I don't have any advice other than to write down everything that is said in the lectures and memorize them. Exams are also proctored. However, they are only worth 30% of the class, so you can get a C on both exams and still get an A in the class.\n\nConclusion\nI'd recommend this class, it's by far the most useful one in the MCS selection. \nOn an easy week, you will dedicate about 6 hours of work. On a hard week with an assignment and exam coming up, you will probably put in 20+ hours.

Even the outdated stuff will give you an idea of how more current tech is being used.  \n\nThe class if very MP heavy compared to other courses which I really enjoyed.  There are a total of 12 MPs some of which require java of python, but a couple which let you choose the programming language of your choice.  You definitely learn real world concepts in this class, it is not heavy on the theory side.  If you are interested in the theory, take CS425.

The workload outside of the MPs is pretty light, but the MPs can be time consuming, especially if you aren't comfortable with programming java or python, or getting your hands dirty with sysadmin/IT type of work.\n\nOverall, if you are interested in cloud deployments or technologies typically seen in a cloud-centric stack this is a great class to take.

I emphasize that everything learned was at an introductory level, if you are okay with that then this course is fine. If you want more in depth on distributed systems take CS 425. Overall I learned a lot and feel what I learned is applicable to the software engineering field.\n\nBad: \nThe MP instructions for the AWS MPs were just links to the official AWS documents and those were sometimes not the clearest or outdated. I spent more time trying to figure out how to do something trivial in AWS than the actual MP implementation. \nThe exams were not intellectually stimulating, they required you to memorize facts about various technologies than how they actually worked for many questions. Also it uses ProctorU, which is terrible. \nAlso, the instructor had no presence on CampusWire at all, he had office hours, but that was it. Also many times, students would give answers on CampusWire quicker and better than TAs. Basically felt like I was learning on my own with a study group of other students, with occasional help from TAs.HelpfulHardLiked12 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2023linkComprehensive Coverage of Fundamental Concepts in Cloud Computing5/27/2023, 6:17 PMPros:\n\n- Comprehensive coverage of a wide range of AWS cloud services, including EC2, ELB, Lex, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Aurora, ElastiCache, Flink, Kinesis, EKS, Glue, Athena, RDS, and API Gateway.\n- In-depth learning of popular big data frameworks like Hadoop MapReduce, Spark MapReduce, HBase, SparkSQL, GraphFrames, MLLib, Storm, and Flux.\n\nCons:\n\n- While the course provides exposure to various tools and frameworks, the level of understanding remains introductory. Each topic is covered independently, lacking in-depth project experience, and the codebase for each assignment is limited. A significant portion of the learning experience involves reading the documentation, which can be challenging, particularly with AWS worse documentation.\n- The course does not include courses on DevOps tools like Terraform, HashiCorp, and Packer.HelpfulMediumLiked10 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2023linkIt was Amazing!5/21/2023, 11:59 AMI did not have experience with cloud, so this was eye-opening. \n\nRest assured AWS will become your lover.

I lightened up by $4.6, but some students dropped $20-$40 on some MP's, so be careful. Bezos needs to eat after all.\n\nI found it difficult to prepare for exams and even more difficult to get good grades on them.\n\n  \nGRADE : A+\n\nDeep DreamerHelpfulMediumStrongly Liked8 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2023linkwouldn't recommend to someone without experience on cloud5/15/2023, 3:42 PMI would like to appreciate this course, but there are several aspects that hinder my enthusiasm. I would not recommend it to individuals who:\n\n-Lack sufficient time to learn everything on their own through online resources like Google.\nOR\n-Lack experience in cloud computing.\n\nRegarding the lectures:\n\nAlthough some students in the industry can skip certain lectures due to their prior knowledge, I have the following thoughts:\n\n-The course covers numerous topics, resulting in superficial coverage of each subject during the lectures. Concepts that deserve a week-long focus are rushed through in a matter of minutes. If you genuinely want to grasp the material, you must dedicate significant time to online research. Merely listing application names without providing instructions on how to use them seems futile. I found more valuable information from ChatGPT than from these lectures.\n\n-Additionally, the lectures lack organization. Some topics should be presented earlier for better comprehension. Even within a single video, the content lacks consistency, with the professor abruptly transitioning from one subject to another. Definitions for certain notions are missing, leaving viewers puzzled about their meaning, applications, and properties. Diagrams that could aid learning are scarce, and instead, the lecture slides are cluttered with obscure terms while the professor attempts to explain everything through plain text.\n\n-As others have already mentioned, the lectures are excessively long compared to other courses, with some stretching up to four hours in a given week.\n\n-Due to the rapid development of cloud technology, certain videos are already outdated, with most of them created in 2021 or even earlier.\n\nRegarding the course assignments (MPs):\n\n-There are a total of 12 MPs in this course, each taking approximately 7-10 hours to complete. However, this is not because the assignments are inherently difficult but rather due to the poor instructions provided. You will spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out what exactly you are supposed to do. The instructions mainly consist of links to external websites, leaving you to search for information on your own since the lectures offer little useful guidance.\n\n-Some autograders lack useful information for debugging purposes. In the case of MP11, I spent nearly 30 hours attempting to debug it, ultimately giving up as I couldn't identify any mistakes. Despite seeking assistance from two TAs, I still could not pass the autograder.\n\n-If you are unfamiliar with cloud computing, you'll got punished to start MPs early since the most helpful debugging resources come from your classmates' replies on Campirswire.\n\nRegarding the exams:\n\n-There are two ProtorU exams in this course. Due to the nature of the lectures, the exams are exceptionally challenging if you do not possess a strong memory. They do not assess your understanding of the topics but rather require you to memorize every line and word from the provided PDF materials, some of which may not even be mentioned in the videos. For instance, you may be asked to match application names with specific AWS services. To achieve a good score, you need to develop your own efficient memorization techniques.\n\nExtra credits:\n\n-An additional 10% of the final score is offered to those who complete seven additional MPs to assist in developing the course for the following year. This places an unfair burden on individuals who work full-time and do not have enough spare time for these assignments. The 10% weightage becomes mandatory, eliminating the option for those who cannot dedicate the necessary time.\n\nIf you decide to take this course, I recommend using it as a catalog and pursuing self-study. Otherwise, it's best to avoid these frustrating experiences altogether.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Disliked15 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2023linkGood course held back from being great by out of date lectures and poor MP instructions5/10/2023, 1:47 PMBottom line:\n-Worthwhile/good course for exposure to different aspects of cloud computing despite some annoyances like older lectures and bad assignment instructions.  \n\nBackground:\n- CS undergrad, two SWE internships.\n- Took Distributed Systems last semester\n\nDifficulty/workload:\n- I give this class 3/5 overall difficulty since the MPs themselves are relatively easy, but the midterm and final (particularly the final) are kinda hard and a ton of information.\n- Total assignments: 11 MPs, 15 quizzes, midterm and final. \n- Manageable workload averaging right around 9.5 hours per week (154.9 tracked hours, I track all my time). \n- My highest single week was 32 hours, but this was because I was working ahead (I finished all lectures and all MPs by around week 8 of the semester, all assignments were released on day 1).\n- Some of the videos are long (each week has anywhere from 2-4 hours), but I didn't find them particularly bad on 2x speed. \n\nGrade:\n- Got an A\n- Quizzes and MPs are essentially free points or close to it since they're unlimited attempts and autograded (respectively). That's 70% of your grade off the bat.\n- The final was really hard IMHO.  For reference I got a 97% on the midterm, and then got a 63% on the final.  Difficult questions on a ton of information, felt like you were playing CCA trivia.\n\nOthers:\n- Some lectures are showing age and the MP instructions are poor and have errors since AWS is always changing. Majority of your time / difficulty with the MPs is trying to gauge what to actually adhere to in the MP instructions and what is outdated. TAs are aware and are actively working on revamping them, but prepare to be frustrated by the MP instructions telling you to go to the wrong screen to do something, or your submission to the grader not working 4, 5, 6 times and then the 7th time you try it, it just works without changing anything. \n- TAs were very active on Campuswire and had consistent office hours, including lots of times holding extra hours around due dates.

For example, they provide some updated MPs for us to try and receive extra credits.\n\nTo be honest, I skipped most of the video lectures. I work as a full-time software engineer and I'm aware of most of the topics in this course. I started each week with the quiz and went directly to the machine problem.

The style is a mile wide and an inch deep, in terms of content and depth. You will encounter so many different tools and technologies that will be helpful in a software engineering career. However, the weekly lectures can be a drag to get through as professor, who is obviously very smart and knows his stuff, delivers information in a somewhat haphazard way without much continuity from topic to topic (although there is some). The lectures present A LOT of information. I would highly recommended taking notes and watching lectures at 1.5x to 2.0x speed so you can re-watch certain segments.\n\nThere are 12 machine problems (programming assignments). There is not a ton of actual coding involved for the most part, but I did get stuck at times in getting the pieces of the assignments to work together. You will become acquainted with many of the offerings of AWS.\n\nThe midterm and final exams are quite tricky (which is why I rated the course as hard as the machine problems aren't that technically challenging per se), although they are worth only 30% of your grade so you can do well in the class without getting As on the exams. I think a final project that brought together a number of different technologies throughout the semester would have been a better capstone than a final exam as this is more of a hands-on type of class.\n\nThis course basically prepares you for what DevOps work is like, with some light data engineering here and there.

There are so many different aspects of cloud computing covered in this course, to the point where I think either the course should be split in two or bumped up to a 500 level course.\nHowever, the amount of lecture videos is ridiculous, around 4+ hours per week. I began skipping the videos and just reading the transcripts during the second half of the course because I couldn\u2019t spend that much time watching videos. It seems like the prof is delivering the lectures the exact same way he would in a traditional setting and has not adapted them to online learning for working professionals. I think some videos could be optional, or at least edited down to remove tangents and times he misspoke.\nQuizzes are OK but nothing special. They only question you on about a quarter to half of what the lectures cover. The midterm and final, however, can cover basically anything from each half of the term, even very specific or obscure topics. You will need to take notes or come up with effective ways to process the lectures besides the quizzes.\nThe MPs were the most helpful for me in terms of learning the material. I didn't take as much issue as others with the vagueness of the instructions, though figuring out what you are supposed to do does consume additional time. The main issue I had with these was the autograder. The instructions weren't always clear on what the autograder wanted, and the error messages from the autograder itself were usually unhelpful and occasionally misleading.\nInstructor/TA availability was poor this semester. I got more and better help from fellow students. Sometimes TAs did have quality answers, but other times you would get no answer at all, or the answer would be unhelpful, or overly defensive if you gave feedback about the class.

Because there is so much material and many homeworks, not all of them hit the mark.  I spent a lot of my time on some of the homeworks just figuring out what was required and what the final output should be.  \n\nThe lack of tutorials on the technologies that will be used within the homeworks besides original documentation from that technology  make it extremely difficult.  However, these issues make you learn and develop a good understanding of these technologies.  I feel like I am able to apply what I learned to my current job.

The content sometimes is not very relevant (i.e. some walk-through on how to edit code from a git repository).\n\nThere's little support from the staff in the MPs. The auto-grader is poorly written and expects a very specific result, else it will blow up and will never give meaningful feedback.\n\nThe midterm and final exams rely a lot on memorization, not really testing the understanding of the concepts, but just memorization of the insanely large lectures.HelpfulMediumNeutral15 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing ApplicationsSpring 2022linkBig mess.

To my surprise, I learned way more than I would have imagined. By the end you'll have read so many research papers that you'll feel confident about doing so in the future and also have the skills to do real research of your own. I was surprised by how much cutting-edge stuff I learned about. Industry is not the only place doing cutting-edge stuff; the academic world impressed me.\n\nThe course is split in two simultaneous pieces:\n\n1) INDIVIDUALLY, you have to read and record a slide-based presentation on 4 different recent research papers of your choosing on the anything in the cloud/distsys space from quality conferences. Your presentations are peer reviewed by students, and you have to peer review other people's presentations (randomly assigned).\n\n2) IN A GROUP OF THREE, you have to come up with a novel research topic, implement it, and write a paper of comparable quality as true publications. The real goal is to actually get published and present in a conference. This is no small task, and you have to complete the project over 5 checkpoints throughout the semester. The research project is probably 2/3 of the work in the course compared with the individual part (not to say that the individual part is easy, because it's not)\n\nChoose your group wisely. Our third group member made empty promises for most of the course, and only by the end did we realize that he had contributed nothing that he was never going to end up contributing anything. We got the course staff involved, and they did a great, fair job with it, but definitely not the ideal.\n\nWhile not required, you'd be smart to choose relevant papers to your research project for like the 3rd and 4th individual presentations you have to make, which will be due in the second half of the course. \n\nI also want to say that in terms of the final result of our research paper, we both worked really hard and also got lucky, which sometimes seem to go hand-in-hand. After the third checkpoint, yes, we had a general topic, but basically we didn't have anything of value. But we dug really deep into two areas (one by me and one by the actually contributing partner), and wouldn't you know, I had a breakthrough right before the 4th checkpoint was due. We just chucked both of our work into the paper haphazardly and turned it in. The professor and TA were able to see, even though the quality of the paper was crap at that point, that we had something of value in my breakthrough, and they encouraged us to do the work and get it cleaned up enough to actually submit to a conference. And wouldn't you know, we did submit to a conference. \n\nTo reiterate, I think we got lucky. It's also not entirely fair. Did we (I) deserve to have a breakthrough? No. Is it fair that my partner's investigations were essentially scrapped in our final paper? No. But he and I were a team and without each other we couldn't have done it. That third group member is not listed as an author on our final paper.\n\nI share all of this just so that you have an idea of what the course of the semester actually looked like for us. And I should mention that we definitely would have gotten a perfectly fine grade in the course even if we had never had a breakthrough. Overall the grading was very generous, especially considering all of unpolished work we turned in along the way.\n\nFinal words of advice: do A LOT of research before choosing a topic. The first checkpoint is to make a project proposal, and if you haven't done a significant amount of research on the subject (far beyond what the first checkpoint requires), you very well may have to change topics later after you've done more research, meaning you very easily may have to go back to the drawing board at some point. Do the research upfront and reap the benefits later. And in general, you just simply can't come up with a novel idea without first having a pulse on the current state of research.\n\nContext:\n* I took this as a full-time student\n* Took this concurrently with Practical Statistical Learning and Distributed Systems (was a ROUGH workload)\n* This was my final semester in the program\n* I had 5 years of professional software development experience prior to starting the program\n* Undergrad was in math (not CS)HelpfulMediumLiked10 hrs/wk", "Cloud Computing CapstoneSummer 2021linkDefinitely enjoyed this course8/4/2021, 8:45 AMI did enjoy this course.

But I could tell some of the lecture content has been more recently refreshed, and the linked research papers are a great complement to lecture material.\n\nWell organized class, with weekly quizzes that contribute to your final grade but don't have strict deadlines (suggested weekly deadlines with no penalties until the end of the semester) and programming assignments that felt challenging but not brutal (MP1 took < 10 hours, MP2 took 15-20 but seemed considerably easier than prior reviews suggest - likely revised? - and MPs 3/4 took maybe 10 hours in total, across all parts). This is with a decent C/C++ background from undergrad and CS 425, but nothing extensive.\n\nProfessor & TAs were very responsive on Campuswire. Final exam was proctored via ProctorU, which is never idea, but the testing environment was less strict than proctored exams in other classes - open notes final, very clear instructions provided to the Proctors and no notable system issues during the final exam period.\n\nPretty easy 'A' if you do all of the MPs - rewarding class with a manageable workload.\n\nOverall, I've been extremely impressed with the MCS program's Systems & Networking courses - the other domains have been a bit more hit or miss, and I wish some of the more advanced S&N classes available to the on-campus program were available to the online MCS as well.HelpfulMediumLiked8 hrs/wk", "Cloud NetworkingFall 2022linkA must take course for this program2/6/2023, 9:14 AMThis course is well organized for its lectures, the materials are prepared in details and well explained. The videos are divided in two parts. The first part is about basic cloud networking concept and the second half is mainly about how a data center works. Although the second half's lecture seems to be a little rush so you'll sometimes need to search and learn online, it's still better than other lectures I took for this online program.\n\nMost of the videos are easy to follow and understand, the most difficult part for this course is MPs. MP1 is about HTTP client, I spent a week on it since the instructions are not very detailed I have to do a lot work by myself, but to someone already have knowledge on HTTP is should be just a few lines of work. MP2 I believe is why most people say this course is quite hard, you can easily spend 40+hours on it, finish this MP means you finish at least 50% of this course. MP3 is quite easy.\n\nTAs and professors are very helpful and they answer questions in a timely manner on campuswire, lots of TA office hours.\n\nThere's only one final exam by protorU, if you review all the lectures carefully there's nothing surprise, easy to get a good grade.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked15 hrs/wk", "Cloud NetworkingFall 2022linkGood courses - prior knowledge required1/12/2023, 11:35 PMThis course may not be suitable for those without any prior experience in C programming, socket programming, and computer systems. The material covered in the class, specifically MP2, was quite difficult and required a significant amount of time and effort. However, the professor and TAs were very supportive and helpful. The second portion of the course, which pertained to cloud networking, was more relevant but also more abstract and harder to understand. Despite the challenges, the class provided a valuable learning experience.HelpfulVery HardLiked35 hrs/wk", "Cloud NetworkingFall 2022linkReally Hard Course, but Great Content12/24/2022, 10:40 AMTBH I had to drop the course because of how hard it was and I didn't have the time commitment with a full-time job and another course. I would not recommend taking this with another course; it was too hard.\n\nYou have to have experience with C/C++ to do well in this course. I didn't have any going in and had to learn it during the course, which was not ideal. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures were very informative and I like how the professor teaches them. This was my first time being introduced to computer networking, and it was definitely fundamental to know.\n\nMPs:\nThey are definitely hard and time-consuming. I recommend starting on it as soon as you can and attending office hours if you have questions or want to ask for clarification/guidance. \n\nTA:\nThe TA does a great job of helping with the course. They released a video to introduce each MP, which was very helpful.\n\nThis is what a graduate course should be. The topic is great and difficult, which will challenge you to learn and grow.

The second MP, which added runtime and memory management constraints, offered a rewarding challenge.\n\nAs a student without a C/C++ programming background, the course was demanding, but the TAs and professor were supportive and offered 1-on-1 Zoom sessions for code reviews and design reviews, which helped.\n\nThe course also featured live sessions with guest speakers, including startup founders and professionals from Cisco and VMWare.\n\nThis course could be improved by teaching students how to use WireShark to visualize network traffic/data, as opposed to writing to logs. This became difficult to debug as networks grew beyond 50 nodes. It was clear that having prior WireShark knowledge helped some students explain issues and debug code more efficiently.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in networking and low-level programming.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked15 hrs/wk", "Cloud NetworkingFall 2022linkI have mixed feelings about this course12/17/2022, 9:37 AMVery good lectures and slide decks (which proved to be really nice to have on the final exam which is open book btw). There are 4 MPs but technically MP3 is part of MP4 so there's truly only 3 major assignments for this course. As others have mentioned, MP2 was super hard and one month was not enough to completely dissect and complete it. I had not coded in C++ in over 5 years so I struggled a lot with the assignments.\n\nGrade breakdown:\n- 10 quizzes (1% each) = 10%\n- MP1 (15%) + MP2 (30%) + MP3/4 (15%) = 60%\n- Final Exam = 30%\n\nThe professor does have a very generous late policy (max 15% off and you can submit things up til the last day of the semester!)\n\nTAs could have been better - it was usually students responding to the questions because the TAs gave vague responses that didn't help fix a problem.\n\nOverall, a solid course and a lot of material is covered.

The lectures are well prepared and delivered, and it's very obvious that Brighten cares--both about his topic and about his students learning the material.\n\nAs others have also said, MP2 is a beast and a half. From a poll of the class, many students took 30-60 hours on this assignment, and a non-egligible number took >120 hours. Having exposure to distributed systems and C/C++ would help immensely, but isn't critical: classmates, TAs, and the professor were all incredibly helpful. This MP is due about half way through the course.\n\nIn light of the \"one big project\" format, the course also came with the most generous late policy I've ever heard of--no more than 15% off, until the end of the semester. While I don't necessarily advise taking advantage of this, the policy gives students absolutely no excuse to give up on any assignment.\n\nThe other large piece of the grade was the final. This was reasonably straight forward, except that the second half of the lecture videos had a slightly different format from the first half and were harder to follow. Still, the exam felt fair; you really had to know your stuff, but nothing on there was on an unexpected topic.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked20 hrs/wk", "Cloud NetworkingFall 2021linkExcellent course!12/16/2021, 12:08 AMExcellent course with great spectrum on cloud networking! 2/3 of the course covers general networking topics like routing policy, BGP, IP, UDP, TCP, DNS, etc. Remaining 1/3 of the course covers networking in datacenter, e.g. Clos topologies, network virtualization, SDN, CDN, etc.\n\nThe lectures are mostly great. Professor Brighten did a great job in explaining various concepts in depth, especially in the first 2/3 of the course.\n\nThe remaining 1/3 of the course involve lectures and reading various seminal research papers. Those lectures were a bit outdated as they were prepared 5+ years ago and identical to the Cloud Networking MOOC on Coursera. While the research papers are fascinating to read, I found the corresponding lectures a bit shallow. I wish the professors could spend more time talking about more details in these papers and provide more insights.\n\nThe course involves four MPs and 1 comprehensive final exam. The MPs are mostly manageable, except MP2 which you could easily spend 40+ hours to get things working. The final exam is comprehensive making up 30% of the grade; the saving grace is that the final exam is open notes. If you watch all the videos and read the papers to understand all the concepts at high level, you will do just fine.\n\nOverall, if you are into Cloud Computing, this course will help you gain great insights on datacenter networking, especially on what's behind the scene in the datacenters of the public cloud providers.

Brighten (the instructor) and Ankit (who gives some of the lectures in the second half of the class) are great teachers who are passionate about their subject and care about teaching well. The TAs are active and helpful as well. The material is very interesting and relevant. \n\nNegatives: I think we could have dived a little bit deeper into some of the material. I also think the workload could have been better distributed between MPs; the second MP was _by far_ the longest and most difficult.

MP1 was a simple client/server communication. Somewhat simple to do, but great practice.\nMP2 is by far the hardest part of this course. Involves network node discovery and message transmission.\n\nThe remaining weeks are about data centers. To be honest this part of the class was underwhelming, with easy assignments in python. Though it's a double edged sword, because the first 9 weeks were exhausting.\n\nPlenty of weekly office hours! I believe one was with the instructor, Brighten, and the rest were with TAs.\nBrighten, is very good. Consistently attended office hours, and provided great support. \n\nTAs were super helpful, too. One of them even hopped on a few zoom calls with me outside of normal hours to help me work through MP2. \n\nThere was one proctored exam at the end.

{"course_title": "Computational Photography", "course_name": "CS 445", "details": ["Computational PhotographySpring 2024linkReally Good Course8/28/2024, 11:54 AMI took this course along with one other in my first semester of the program. I found the class to be enjoyable as the lectures talked about many different topics and actually discussed them for a bit rather than glancing over them. As much as I liked the lectures, sometimes they were dry and long to the point they were hard to listen to if I didn't take a short break.\n\nThere are \"practice quizzes\" at the end of most lectures which are supposed to help with the exams but I found that to only be applicable for the final and not the midterm. I found both exams to be difficult but still fair material-wise. The final is cumulative so there's a lot more to remember for it but I thought it was much easier than the midterm. That said I still did well on both exams. They are not on ProctorU so big big win for the class.\n\nThe MP's were the most rewarding part of the class and the main reason why I found this class hard. They cover very interesting topics and really get you working on the math but the end result is super cool. You'll need to earn 500 points across 5 MP's but there's so much extra credit under the \"bells and whistles\" that I was able to get 500 points from doing the first 3.5 MP's fully (including all the extra credit). You also get a total number of \"late days\" across the semester that you can use on any project which was very helpful as my schedule got really busy at one point.\n\nThere was also a final project. Just need to have a good group for it since it is a big one. The more points from the MP's you have before the final project the better because the last MP and the final project overlap a lot in scheduling and it's hard to balance them.\n\nOverall a great class, ended with an A-.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked12 hrs/wk", "Computational PhotographySpring 2023linkFun assignments and tough exams7/31/2023, 2:41 AMI'm working full-time and took DL4H as well, got A in both.\n\nThe exams were pretty tough and are done without proctoring which is a big plus for this course. The questions are complex and specific, they did a good job building an exam that really tests your knowledge without having someone watching you scratch your head.\n\nThe lectures cover too much content maybe, the world of Computational Photography is wide and the amount of techniques and methods we learned was a bit overwhelming. It will probably need some refreshing now that this field is rapidly changing. \n\nThe assignments were the fun part, they guide you very well and let you use external methods. You use your own photos which is fun and gives something to show.\n\nThe final project is the coolest I had in the degree.

I came in with no background in opencv, lots in numpy, far removed from linear algebra, though I've had some review of it throughout the program. It was a great intro to working with images and manipulating them in interesting ways, which is easier than you think, though I wouldn't say this class is easy. I was a stranger to most concepts taught and learned a lot. I took this class alone while working full time.\n\nI would consider this a computer vision class, because a lot of the concepts taught are highly applicable to the field of CV. Machine learning, though briefly mentioned at points, is not a component of this class, but you could easily adapt what you learn to perform a machine learning related final project, though that may be very difficult if you haven't been introduced to machine learning yet.\n\nThis class was not super time consuming for me until the end of the semester, and that is mostly because I chose a very difficult final project topic and my project partner ended up withdrawing, so I had to do it alone. I put the average at 17 hours, but there were maybe two weeks I did no work at all because I was ahead. Before the final 4 weeks, the most I put in was probably around 25. In the final 4 weeks I put in maybe 40-45 hours one week, but again, that was because I put a lot of effort into the final project.\n\nLECTURES:\n\nI felt the lectures were a great overview and covered the necessary materials. I enjoyed watching them.\n\nWEEKLY QUIZZES:\n\nThese are ungraded, but they provide a good test of knowledge and are good prep for the exams.\n\nPROJECTS:\n\nThere were 5 projects that were the core of this class and worth the majority of the grade. The projects were very informative and fun. You can produce some cool, interesting, and funny images, especially if you dedicate a little more time to it. For all projects except the last one, you are expected to take your own pictures and use them for some sections, so that gives you some freedom to explore that you don't get in other classes, though it is more work.\n\nThere are many bells and whistles for each project and if you complete enough, you can completely skip the last of the 5 projects. Some of the B&W aren't too difficult. I did several on projects 1, 3, and 4, though I did spend a ton of time working on some items that I ended up not completing. Project 5 was, in my opinion, way more difficult than the other projects and I was glad I completed enough B&W to only need to do the first section.\n\nProjects 1-3 were kind of focused on combining images in different ways (combining low freq of one image with high freq of another, applying texture from one image to another, placing an object from one image into another and making it look natural).\n\nProject 4 was about reproducing the lighting environment of an image and using Blender to place 3D objects into it. This is where you need a mirror ball.\n\nProject 5 was image stitching using frames of a video, extracting foreground/background objects, and a ton of B&W that I wish I had time to do.\n\nLectures and starter code provided everything needed to do the projects. There may be exceptions for some of the bells and whistles. I felt the grading was very fair. If you put in the effort and it shows, you'll be rewarded, but there are some questions you need to answer and if you get them wrong you will be penalized. I had no issues getting full points for my work.\n\nEXAMS\n\nThere were 2 exams, a midterm covering the first half of the class, and a final that was comprehensive. The exams weren't too bad. Open book, not proctored, but if you aren't regularly reviewing the material from previous lectures, you may need hours and hours of study to prepare, especially for the final. I thought some of the questions were kind of hard. I didn't do super well on the final.\n\nFINAL PROJECT\n\nThis was a very open-ended project. As long as you are working with images in some way you are probably good, as long as it is advanced enough. Find a group early. Come up with project ideas early. Get started early. It will save you a lot of pain, especially if you end up in my situation, and your partner withdraws from the class. If you procrastinate finding a partner and then can't, and try to proceed alone, you will lose points when you turn in a solo project. I was allowed to proceed alone after my partner left as I had already put some work into it. It was a difficult project, but definitely portfolio material :)\n\nIn summary, I loved this class and with some work was able to get an A. It was a great opportunity to learn CV stuff and apply it. I would recommend it to anyone in the program.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked17 hrs/wk", "Computational PhotographySpring 2023linkHigh level of effort, room for improvement5/15/2023, 5:57 AMThe other reviews of this course do a good job of covering logistics, important policies, and tips for succeeding. Before this course, I brushed up on linear algebra, python, numpy, and opencv. I  worked ahead on the MPs and did all of the bells and whistles early in the course so I had enough time to finish the course project and study for exams. For me, the mathematics were challenging and the MPs were time consuming, but I was able to make an A in the course. If you are experienced with numpy and image processing, it may not be as challenging.\n\nThe MPs were overly time consuming because working with image data can be more tedious to debug than usual programming. Since the MPs are all Jupyter notebooks, they frequently crashed and the kernel had to be had be restarted. Some of the algorithms take several minutes to execute.\n\nYou have to find images, or take photos that highlight the problem & solution well. Each MP must be submitted with a report that includes your best solutions. Like other reviews have stated, sometimes compiling the report takes longer than completing the exercises in the MP. Reading through the report template before beginning the project will save you time because you need to know what artifacts are required for the report.\n\nThe MPs assignment descriptions are somewhat outdated, unclear, and lacking in background information. There are also inconsistencies between the lectures, MP assignments, and report templates. Fortunately, you can use basically any outside resources to learn the concepts as long as you cite references properly. I found outside references to be more helpful than the lectures and readings for the course.\n\nGrading for the MPs is overly hyper-critical. Points are unfairly deducted for insignificant details. For some projects, the instructor and TAs didn't provide enough detail on what the expected results should be, and then deducted points in the final score. I got the impression they were intentionally looking for ways to deduct points and keep scores lower in this course.\n\nOn the bright side, the TAs and instructor were very responsive on Campuswire and office hours to address any questions! You could also submit a regrade request for all of the MPs if you think your project was not graded correctly!\n\nMy overall impression of the course is not positive. I think the level of effort required is too high given the time consuming nature of the MPs. However if you are really interested in learning computer vision and computational photography then it would be a valuable use of your time.HelpfulHardNeutral18 hrs/wk", "Computational PhotographySpring 2022linkAmazing foundational course for computer vision5/21/2022, 1:25 PMThere are other reviews here that focus on how to do well in this course, which is what I used to do well in this course. What I will focus on is why you should take this course and why you should not take this course.  At the end I'll provide my metrics on workload and difficulty justification.\n\nWHY SKIP?\n- You want an easy A\n- You want to take multiple courses to graduate this semester while working FT.\n- You care little for photography or computer vision\n\nWHY TAKE?\n- You've been exposed (ha) to CV Deep Learning techniques already (this was me), but didn't know little about what happens before the images show up to your model.\n- You think CV is all about Models and maybe a little to do with color spaces. Hint: Projective Geometry and Image Processing are pillars and have multiple open areas of research.\n- You want those tough MPs that solidify concepts through struggle.\n\nI'm pretty diligent about tracking my time per class and type of activity. I've listed 12.5 hours average for this class, but the last 4 weeks (excluding spring break) saw 23, 33, \n20 and 25 hrs each.  Those weeks had both a MP and Final project work and final exam prep taking place.\n\nIn terms of breakdown I spent 45% of my time coding MPs, 35% time reviewing content+quizzes+exam prep and the remaining 20% of total time on the final project.\n\nAs for difficulty, only the last 4 weeks make this class especially Hard.  The rest of the class is Medium to Easy if you can commit the time needed week in and week out.\n\nGrade: AHelpfulHardStrongly Liked12.5 hrs/wk", "Computational PhotographySpring 2022linkThis course is rigorous. And I learned a lot.5/20/2022, 9:26 AMAmong all 8 courses I've taken in this program, this is probably the most rigorous courses with pretty heavy projects, exams and a final project.\n\nI also feel I learned the most from this course. The course materials and assignments are well designed, covering the basics of computer vision and computer photography.\n\nThe 5 projects are very interesting to work on. Most of them are applications of topics covered in the lectures. And they usually involve generating very interesting result images. The projects are also very challenging. With basic knowledge of numpy and related packages, it still took at least 10-15 hours per project. It will be even longer when debugging is needed. So highly recommend to start early.\n\nThe mid term and final exams are open book. The difficulty is medium to me. \n\nThe final project requires a group of 2-4. We can choose our own topics, such as implementing a paper. However, this course has an anecdotally high drop-off rate due to its difficulty. Some groups were disbanded very late.\n\nThere are some cons of this course:\n- Some of the code examples and provided utils can benefit from more comments and better quality.\n- Some projects feel repetitive. Such applying the same methods on different images, and copy-paste results into a report. This sometimes feels a bit unnecessary.\n- The grading information is not always up-to-date. Many of us could not see our mid term or project proposal grade on Coursera, until the last day of the course.\n- There are some project criteria that are subjective. There were usually 10 quality points for each project. But the instruction did not specify how quality is defined.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked15 hrs/wk", "Computational PhotographySpring 2020linkHands on 2D computer graphics with applications.11/15/2021, 10:08 AMThis course covers image processing techniques using statistics and other heuristics that may or may not involve a camera covering 5 main categories:  convolution, texture synthesis, gradient, image based lighting, and homography. \n Each MP covers papers submitted to ACM SIGGRAPH (www.siggraph.org), and are considered fundamental algorithms of 2D computer graphics (That's another way of saying they're also quite old).  Some of the algorithms appear in popular applications like Adobe Photoshop.  Students should have basic linear algebra knowledge such as multiplying matrices, vector dot product, vector cross product, singular value decomposition, and determinants.  Expect to spend a LOT of time on this course.\n\nThe course consists of:\n- lecture videos (~90 minutes per week)\n- weekly quizzes (not graded)\n- midterm exam\n- final exam\n- 5 machine problems with associated reports\n- 'bells and whistles' (extra work on machine problems)\n- course project\n\nLecture material is quite verbose compared to other courses in the online MCS program, but well presented.  Most videos are 20-25 minutes apiece and cover one or two topics in depth.  Each week has roughly 90 minutes of lecture material.  The first 10 weeks is material you'll use in the machine problems while the final 4 weeks are FYI on broader topics too involved to do as machine problems for the course.  Compared to other courses, lectures are more in-depth and cover a single topic over the entire week, and are good lead-ins to computer vision.\n\nThere are 2 quizzes every week, but they are not graded.  I would recommend taking the quizzes as they cover topics and material you don't get in the machine problems.  There are also 2 practice exams as preparation for the midterm and final exams.  Definitely take those as they are very similar to the actual exams.\n\nThe first few weeks involve getting set up in jupyter notebook and OpenCV.  We used python to read/write 2D image data, and using library functions from OpenCV for image processing.  OpenCV has a few quirks to it, so time early in the course should be spent doing fundamental stuff like learning to read/write images from the file system, creating plots in matplotlib, using numpy, and so on.  If you're fumbling around on these tasks after week 4, it'll slow you down to the point of pain.\n\nYou should also invest in a gazing ball early in the course because you'll be competing with every gardener on planet Earth for stock come spring time.  Most of the gazing balls come from Taiwan, so you need to account for shipping time.  If you wait until spring break, it may be too late.  Yes, Amazon does sell out.  The gazing ball will be needed for the image based lighting machine problem as you'll use it to capture the surrounding environment from it's reflection.  The reflection will be processed with various math to convert it into a half dome for use in re-lighting 3D objects in Blender.  An ideal gazing ball will be a large, chrome ball polished like a mirror with no visible seams or color tint, and perfectly spherical.  If the gazing ball is too small, the resulting image will be too low resolution and lack detail.  If the gazing ball is too large, it will be expensive and cumbersome to use.  A diameter of 8 - 10 inches (20 - 26 cm) is a good compromise between size and price.\n\nIf you haven't worked with computer graphics before, get used to working with 3D and 4D arrays, and array operations (vectorized) using numpy.  You'll be doing a lot of region selection, copy/paste of regions, processing individual channels, row/column operations using boolean masks, and so on.  Some projects will execute to excruciatingly slow speeds (30+ minutes) if you write sloppy code.  Spend the time to learn how to write smart code with vectorization.  Also take the time to analyze every assignment's requirements.  Some will present methods of accomplishing the task that are easy to describe, but are not necessarily efficient.  A little analysis before you begin work could pay very big dividends in time savings.\n\nEach machine problem has the usual requirements of programming the assignment in jupyter notebook, a written report, and extra tasks called \"bells and whistles\".  It's a very time consuming course as many tasks are iterative.  Writing code that compiles without error is not the solution to the problem.  You need to go further and solve the use case which requires a lot of trial and error to find out where the algorithms work, where they fail, then adjusting your code to account for those situations.  Success/failure is dependent on your ability to find a variety/breadth of use cases to apply the principle.  On any given assignment, you'll spend 60% of the time getting the code to work, then the other 40% doing the report and use cases.  The course project is essentially another machine problem, but you get to choose the topic and you have the option of working in teams or alone.\n\nIn addition to the machine problems, you also need to do \"bells and whistles\" which are tasks related to the machine problem which apply the lesson you've learned.  Each bells and whistles task has a point value which can be interpreted as a ranking of how difficult / time consuming the task is.  You must accrue 'x' bells and whistles points over the course of the semester.  Do as many bells and whistles as early in the course as possible.  Why?  Because as the course progresses, the topics become more complex and time consuming leaving less time to do the bells and whistles.  The bells and whistles tasks get more time consuming too.  Some bells and whistles tasks from the early weeks are offered again later in the semester, but the point is to do the heavy work early so you're not overwhelmed later in the course.\n\nBecause of the time investment in this course, fatigue can be a real factor when you get to week 11, 12, 13, ...  So that's another reason to attack bells and whistles early, and also to learn to pace yourself.\n\nThe exams are fairly run of the mill exams for a computer graphics course and follow the format of the practice quizzes fairly closely.  Half of the questions are computation, but nothing more than arithmetic or very basic linear algebra.  The other half of the questions are reasoning, fact recall, and the like.  Many questions will have associated illustrations to guide your response.\n\nKeys to success:\n\n- Do assignments early and experiment a LOT.  \n- Do bells and whistles as early as you can.\n- Do visit office hours often, even if you're on top of things.  Graphics is a very broad topic, and there's always something to learn.\n- Do brush up on basic linear algebra and python numpy skills.\n- Do try out whatever you read.  Often you'll find what you read doesn't work the way you thought it would when done in practice.\n- Do practice writing smart code with vectorization.\n- Do start thinking about your final project topic as soon as you can.\n\n\nDO NOT procrastinate - these projects consume too much time to be able to succeed playing from behind.  Once you fall behind you'll find it very difficult to get back on track.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked30 hrs/wk"]}

They actually relate to content learned in the class and again covered concepts that were cool and made you genuinely excited to do the MP. They are structured in a way that splits it up into different parts which progressively get harder. This helps because you don't feel discouraged at the size of the MP and rather can attack it in smaller chunks. There was an autograder which you can run as many times as you want before the submission deadline so you pretty much know your grade before turning it in (a small chunk is manually graded as well). The assignments were primarily in python and java. \n\nThe TAs and students were always active on Campuswire so anytime someone had a question it was quickly answered with a short response time. There are two exams - the midterm and the final. Both are open-note and MC. Not exactly a walk in the park but if you have been following lectures it shouldn't be too hard, especially considering the fact you can use outside resources. \n\nI am walking away having learned a lot of information from this class, refined coding and debugging skills, and a plethora of knowledge on computer security. Highly recommend all students to take this class.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Computer Security IISpring 2023linkQuality course with interesting assignments6/13/2023, 9:38 PMThis course covers a wide range of security concepts and principles, and you'll feel more prepared to make secure systems. I suspect you'll also feel a bit unnerved at how sophisticated some exploits can be.\n\nIn my opinion, this course is much more put-together than some of the previous reviewers have opined. My reasoning: this course is like a REAL UNIVERSITY COURSE. Perhaps some people expected this class to be like many others where all you have to do is complete a few software projects where you submit as many times as you like til you pass their nice test cases. And don't get me wrong, I like that type of thing; it's very much like doing real work in industry. The assignments in this course, however, felt much more like doing software engineering INTERVIEWS: you better really know it because you only have one shot.\n\nHere are a few particulars about this course:\n* the lectures are very carefully curated by the professor and overall quite engaging and interesting and always closely tied to one or more research papers. He included pdfs of the slides (two per week).\n* The assignments were pretty cool and quite varied: finding which Bitcoin transactions the FBI used to confiscate from criminals, tricking a Android app classifier into thinking a good app is malware and vice versa, password guessing, etc.\n* Each assignment was like 90% code which had to be submitted via Github and you didn't know the hidden tests in advance, so you had to be pretty sure that you had it right by the time of the due date. That said, the assignment instructions were very clear, so you could be confident that you were at least mostly right (I didn't miss any points on the coding portion of the assignments). The other 10% or so of each assignment was single-submission multiple choice questions. Some of those got me. But it forced me to really learn. Overall, I thought this method of doing assignments was impressive.\n* The exams are hard (all multiple choice; no code), but you don't have to ace them to do well in the course. I got like an 84 on the midterm and like a 93 on the final and still was able to manage an A+ (and no, there wasn't any extra credit).\n\nI wouldn't consider this course to be a must-take, but if you need to fulfill a breadth requirement, then definitely two thumbs up in that regard. It certainly broadened my understanding of the larger software universe.\n\nMy context:\n* first semester in the program\n* full-time student\n* 3 total courses (other courses were IoT and CCA)\n* 5-year professional software engineering backgroundHelpfulMediumLiked12 hrs/wk", "Computer Security IISpring 2023linkA non ordinary security course5/20/2023, 2:53 AMThis is a course unlike any security course outside, it focus on teaching you the mindset of researchers, to approach to a security problem systematically. A wide variety of modern security topics are discussed, including Bitcoin, Autonomous vehicle, Privacy, Inference, Machine Learning, Cyber Warfare etc. The format of lecture does not follow any books but Professor would discuss about a representative paper that he chose that is related to modern security topics. The course videos are new as it\u2019s taken last year and still up to date. I personally found this kind of lecture really amazing because it\u2019s not something that you could read from textbook but rather what professor thinks it\u2019s important. Gang has an ability to explain abstract concept in a very simple way that you would easily understand. The chosen topics are also closely related to our daily life and you will find it quite practical and interesting. At least I feel amazed when I learn about Private set Intersection and really implemented it in the MP.\n\nSpeaking of MP, it is mainly related to the lectures, you would need a good understanding of the concepts behind. Since it is a data focused security course, it also assumed that you have some background in data science, at least know something about classifiers and clustering algorithm. As I did not have any data science background, I had a hard time during MP1 since it requires you to implement a clustering algorithm from scratch using only numpy. But I also learned a lot from it and the MPs forced me to bite the bullet and learn those data science concepts. (P.S. helper functions are definitely allowed in the MPs.) TAs are also responsive and helpful to guide you through the MPs, given that you start early and asks good questions. My favourite MP was one that using the power of inferencing to find out the bitcoin address of Silk Road from real bitcoin transaction data. Exams are all MC this year and unfortunately they do not have essay nor extra credits. My final grade is A+. \n\nOverall it is a great course, don\u2019t miss it out because of the bad reviews, strongly recommend anyone that has interest in computer security to take this course.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked12 hrs/wk", "Computer Security IISpring 2023linkNeeds Work4/13/2023, 4:46 PMUnfortunately, the frustration is real on the unclear requirements.  It is not difficult to understand or grasp but the problem is you do not know how they want you to do it and there is no way to test your code, e.g. no actual checkpoints or auto-grader.\n\nInitial launch of the class GitHub was improperly deployed causing some troubleshooting that ate up time when we only had two TA sessions a week that did not fit several working adult schedules.  At least two of the TAs were helpful but some did not give clear answers on Campuswire.\n\nThe video lectures were pretty good and I liked the topics but since the course grade is weighted heavily toward the MPs, they need to work on providing clear requirements.  I passed the midterm with a solid score but unfortunately, I did not have the time to deal with shenanigans.\n\nI ended up dropping the course two months in and used the remainder of the semester to achieve two desirable Cybersecurity certifications instead.\n\n\nEdit:  Since later reviews are attempting to discredit other reviews instead of keeping it focused on their personal experience with the course, I felt it would be right to provide more context.\n\nMost of the lectures and MPs are based on different scholarly articles.  You can find each one to get more information than what is covered in class.  I showed up to office hours for MP1 since, as another review mentions, you have to create a clustering algorithm but the MP being a clustering algorithm was not annotated any where.  During office hours, the professor about laughed at me when I was asking about MP1 and told me, \"it is just a simple social inference algorithm\" without answering my question or pointing me in the right direction.\n\nI work over full-time, have a family of five, my wife's father died recently causing some unexpected expenses and travel, and I am very involved with other professional development activities.  This was my 6th course in the program, TIS has been my favorite so far since I was able to dive deeper and apply some of the concepts to start generating the data we would need to use Machine Learning in my career.  Even though the first half starts rocky, I am also enjoying SV and should be on track for another A~.  Three A+s and two As in the program so far, if that matters.\n\nOffice hours were only being held during business hours, I had to find coverage any time I wanted to attend.  Additionally, when I asked about the office hours schedule, the professor told me to shift my work around it.  This was not a possibility for me since I work in a SCIF but at least they took it into consideration since they eventually shifted one of the sessions.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I liked the topics and if you are only a student, then this course can be very enjoyable.  However, it is important to note that when you are working on real world problems, you have requirements you must meet and you can test your implementations.  In this course, there is no second chance, the requirements are unclear and there is no method to test your implementation.  This mostly related to MP1 since MP2 had a little more clarity and the TAs were actually helpful.\n\nThe same TAs for MP1 were in charge of MP3.  Looking at the assignment, I did not have the time to deal with unclear requirements, an unhelpful professor and unhelpful TAs.  I then dropped the course because I decided to focus on important family-life events while taking advantage of extra professional development opportunities.\n\n\nYou can find this course very enjoyable since it covers Data Security topics you would not normally read about and the topics are very enlightening while not difficult to grasp.  If you are only interested in the topics and do not want to chance a horrible experience that one-fourth to one-third of the class faced, you can just find scholarly articles based on the topics of the syllabus.HelpfulEasyDisliked10 hrs/wk", "Computer Security IISpring 2023linkThis class is a dumpster fire3/20/2023, 11:17 AMThis class is a total disaster.

Grading for individual homeworks (MPs) inexplicably takes 2-3 weeks, and, shockingly, in 2023, they don't have an autograder for the MPs. For instance, for MP1, 26% of the class got a straight up zero on something that was 4.5 total points for the course due to ill-defined project requirements and opaque clarity on how the MP would be graded. Another example, for MP5, (buried in a campuswire post) a TA noted that you couldn't use user-defined helper functions to implement your code (seriously). I spent more time petitioning my score for one MP than I did on the actual coding. For the other MPs, I probably spent double to triple the amount of time it required if the requirements were actually clear, due to paranoia about getting knocked for something that was announced late or assumed.

The actual code isn't hundreds of lines, but each homework assignment took me the full 3 weeks to understand and implement.  MP4 was a bit of a mess as it was a new assignment, and had to be done in an EC2 instance (no instructions on how to set this up were given, but if you have been through CCA it will be intuitive, if not, there are a ton of resources out there).  You will have to do research on each MP, and the grading on the MP questions are specific and test knowledge of the concepts (a few are a little tricky).

This was my third class, and after starting with IoT and CCA the workload felt comically light.  However, that doesn't mean I didn't learn anything or this class isn't valuable.  If you have experience in front end coding and Tableau, and don't need an easy A this is not the class for you.\n  \nI do not have front end coding experience, but some experience in Tableau.  I found the first half of the class interesting but not challenging.  The material went into some physiology which was unexpected but pretty interesting.  The first project was graded pretty generously and very open ended.  You could make the project very easy or very difficult depending on what you chose to do.  The midterm was a little tricky, but I thought it was relatively fair.  If you take the time to know the core of the teaching, you may  have to think about a few of the questions but should end up with the right answers.  \n\nThe second half of the class was more focused on D3.  I had only a slight knowledge of JavaScript from high school, so it was a good refresher on JavaScript.  I also had never made a webpage, which was important for the final project.  The final project is to make a Narrative Visualization, and was as open ended as the first project.  I enjoyed the second half of the class much more, as I felt I learned a lot more.  Prof. Hart's lectures are short and jam packed with info, and the mini programming assignments in the second half are rewarding once completed.  Grading hasn't come out yet for the final projects and I haven't taken the final exam but I expect them to be similar to the midterm/first project.  I did have a lot of fun doing the final project (even if it was frustrating at times), but there wasn't a ton of info to get you started.\n\nI took this class because I would rather take Sci Vis than Data Curation or Cleaning as a 500 level class, and wanted to complete one of the pre-reqs.  ICG would probably have been a better choice, but I needed a Summer class.  That said, I am also planning on taking Database Systems and hoping this front end experience will help me in that final project.  Overall, it was a light semester, and I think if they added one or two more projects, this would be a great class.  Two weeks were set aside for the midterm/final and two more weeks were set aside to work on the two projects, so there is ample time to do things correctly.

The first half covers the fundamental principals behind effective visualizations of data, and the second half shifts to interactive storytelling.\n\nI didn't have much expectation at the beginning as many people said it was an easy course. It turned out the course required some unexpected hard work and I learned quite a bit in the process.\n\nThe two projects were especially interesting where I learned a lot. The first one is to build data visualization via Tableau, and the second one is to build web-based interactive storytelling with D3.\n\nFor the first project, I didn't know Tableau before, and there was quite a learning curve. More specifically, while there are plenty of learning materials on Tableau out there, find the right materials to learn how to build the specific chart types you needed could be challenging. I ended up watching 8+ hours of Tableau tutorials before finding one covering what I needed. Because of this, some folks simply sticked with the simplest chart types possible in the project to do the minimal, but this completely missed the point in taking this course to learn how to present the data in the best possible way.\n\nFor the second project, I haven't done any web development in JavaScript for years, and it took me a while to brush up my skills. That said, D3 is very powerful, and it is fun to use. Creating great visualization requires hard work, but I was really amazed by the kind of visualization I was able to create in the final project.\n\nOverall, it is a good course to learn the data visualization principles and how to make it happen. I have already put what I learned into good use whenever I need to visualize data in presentations at work. I recommend this course if you are willing to put in the effort to take it seriously, as equipping with the principles and knowledge on how to create great data visualization will be helpful to your career down the road.HelpfulMediumLiked8 hrs/wk", "Data VisualizationSummer 2021linkGood Pace10/27/2021, 9:41 AMRecommend brushing up on JavaScript and D3 prior to taking course.

It's that the class was... missing? Read an easy-reading viz book in 10-15 hours, then do a few more in independent tutorials on Tableau and D3. Suddenly, you'd have learned more than I did in this entire class.\n\nThe homework was very basic HTML/JS, and the projects didn't take much longer than the homework unless you opted into creating work for yourself. The biggest time commitment in the class was the final project, which was mostly open ended. Since it was with D3, it made a decent excuse to self-study some JS. Still, a class's best learning shouldn't come from just being an excuse. A class should have a solid curriculum, and this wasn't it.\n\nThe class tried to slightly compensate for all this with a terribly written extremely short midterm. This exam seemed designed to test concept understanding via trick questions. A pointless way to challenge students, and unfortunately the only challenge I found throughout--besides some minor technical issues with an unmaintained assignment.\n\nOf course, nothing is ever entirely bad. The redeeming parts were the production quality for the videos, and the teaching staff. The slides were well organized, and the audio and video crisp. Seamless, even. To the staff, John Hart is a crystal clear lecturer and was very helpful when approached with questions during office hours. The course staff as a whole were supportive, and reviewed project progress with students when asked. This let proactive students refine their viz skills with feedback.\n\nOn the whole, the class left me with many more negative impressions than positive ones. This was because of missing content, which is the very core of any course. If you want to learn for your credits, I encourage you to skip this class.

The second project was to create a narrative visualization with at least 3 scenes using D3 JavaScript. Needless to say, the first part of the course focused on very high level principles of Data Visualization. The second part of this course required low-level programming.

I personally felt insulted by this, but my feelings aside, the book changed three times in the first 8 weeks, and then these reflections were cancelled after week 8 - 50% way through the semester.\n2. MPs - these were challenging, and I liked them to an extent. I also disliked them, though, because it was very unclear how, exactly we'd be graded. Each MP has a limited number of submissions, so you have to learn how to balance trial-and-error needed to figure out how you're gonna be graded, and the limit. I ended up getting really good at that trial-and-error, and advanced my deep learning skills less.\n4. The midterm - the exam was announced _after_ the semester started. I don't know if this was a communication issue, the teaching staff decided to add it too late, or something else, but to me it seems wrong to tell students about a major new component to our grades after we already committed to the class\n5. The final project - I know a lot of fellow students had a huge amount of trouble with this part, but my project partner and I didn't. I think we were already used to the fact that nobody is here to help you in this course and we're completely on our own. I think we both enjoyed this component, because it was more open ended and we didn't have any of the arbitrary, unclear, and often byzantine expectations that came with the MPs.\n6. Dishonorable mention: Piazza - Piazza was the course forum this semester, and we were instructed to ask our questions publicly so everyone can benefit from the answers. I see nothing wrong with that, and it makes sense. The problem is, the professor and TAs were very unresponsive, relatively speaking. They did, however, classify some students as something like \"agents\" who can help answer questions on their behalf (I think if you're a student and you're very active and helpful on the forum, you get this classification). My experience with one of those people on the forum was negative -- I asked a question that I know was reasonable and had many up-votes from other curious students -- and I got a very unhelpful (at best) answer. At least 3 other students concurred\n\t- Unfortunately, my experience with the TAs and professor was only marginally better. When they did answer questions (both mine and other students'), they seemed to provide minimal -- and thus, relatively unhelpful -- answers.\n7. Lectures - these were little more than the professor reading either formulae or text on a screen. This is not my learning style (I'd be willing to bet it's not the style of many other students as well), so I was very disappointed with these. Given there was very little additional reading (see notes about weekly reflections, above), the most effective way to learn the material for me (and at least several other students) was YouTube and materials from Stanford's ML classes.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Disliked20 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2024linkAvoid at All Costs: My Nightmare Experience with \"Deep Learning for Healthcare\"5/20/2024, 11:17 AMInstructor: Sun, Jimeng\n\nCourse Experience Date: Spring 2024\n\nI regretfully took \"Deep Learning for Healthcare\" with Professor Jimeng Sun, and it was the worst educational experience I've ever had. Here\u2019s why:\n\nFirst, the course was extremely disorganized from start to finish. Lectures were based on an outdated textbook, while the professor was in the process of writing a new one. This led to a complete mismatch between lectures and readings, creating confusion every week. Sun released new chapters weekly, which felt like he started writing the textbook when the course began. This level of poor planning is unacceptable. There were sudden changes, such as the introduction of a midterm halfway through the course with minimal notice and a narrow scheduling window, adding unnecessary stress.\n\nSecond, Professor Sun was completely disengaged. He never responded to questions on Piazza and failed to show up for his office hours multiple times without proper notice. The TAs were equally unhelpful, often not responding to Piazza questions and providing minimal assistance during office hours. The lack of support was incredibly frustrating.\n\nThird, lectures were shallow, with significant gaps in the material. Important concepts were rushed through without adequate explanation, making it impossible to grasp deep learning fundamentals from this course. The content was riddled with errors, such as incorrect equations and misleading explanations. This was extremely detrimental, especially for students new to deep learning. Reflections on the new textbook felt like free labor. Weekly reflections focused on proofreading rather than understanding, which was a complete waste of time.\n\nFourth, the grading rubrics were inconsistent and unclear. Homework submissions were auto-graded with poor feedback, making it difficult to improve. The project guidelines were vague, and support for accessing necessary resources was nonexistent. Many students had to spend out of pocket for compute resources without any guidance from the course staff.\n\nFinally, both the professor and TAs were rude and unresponsive. The complete lack of engagement and respect for students was appalling. The sudden introduction of a midterm and chaotic timeline demonstrated a lack of consideration for students\u2019 schedules and commitments.\n\nIn conclusion, this course was a nightmare. I\u2019ve taken four other courses, all without issues, but this was a complete waste of money and time. Avoid this course at all costs if you value your education and well-being.HelpfulMediumStrongly Disliked10 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2024linkChanging tires on a moving car experience5/8/2024, 12:17 AMInstructor: Sun, Jimeng\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is only relevant for the Spring 2024 iteration and may not hold for future iterations.\n\nWeekly Time Breakdown:\nTotal: 120.37 hr, Mean: 7.08 hr, Min: 1.67 hr, Max: 17.77 hr, SD: 4.31 hr\n\nBackground:\n- 7th course in the MCS program\n- Only course this term\n- Full time Software engineer (> 5 YoE)\n- Employer covering tuition\n\nGrade Breakdown:\n- 25% HW (5x)\n- 20% Reflection (12x)\n- 15% Midterm\n- 40% Project\n\nMaterial:\nThe course is a survey course covering concepts in deep learning and presented in the context of health care applications. Partial list of topics: Deep NN, Convolutional NN, Recurrent NN, LSTM, Autoencoders, Attention, Generative models.\n\nLectures:\nAll lectures are given by Sun and are based on a textbook. However Sun decided to write a totally new textbook and did not update the lecture videos as well. So a lot of the time, the lectures were mis-matched with the current week's chapter. It really seemed like Sun decided to start writing the textbook when the course started because the staff would release a new chapter each week. It was a very poorly organized experience.\n\nOther than that, the lectures (based on the old textbook) were fairly short, usually 1-2 hours per week. I'd say they were also pretty shallow in content, if you want to learn more, read the old textbook. This observation may not necessarily mean anything because the next offering might produce new videos.\n\ntl;dr: hope the videos and readings in the next iteration will be in sync.\n\nSupport:\nSun is not involved at all in the day to day of the course. You will interact with the TAs. I think the TAs are not all that responsive on Piazza. If I were more charitable, it would be that the TAs are not empowered to answer student questions relating to course logistics. Having said that, the TAs were accessible at their OH, so I am puzzled as to why that didn't exactly translate to being responsive on Piazza.\n\nI suspect Sun does not really care much for this course. While he does have OH, at some point in the term, he didn't show up to his OH for a couple of weeks and only recently put a note hours before that he wasn't going to make the OH that day.\n\ntl;dr: hope that your fellow students are knowledgeable of the material and generous with their knowledge on Piazza.\n\nHomeworks:\nThe HWs are done solo, and you work with Jupyter notebooks through Coursera. Same experience as AML. Main difference is that the HWs have only 5 submission attempts allowed.\n\nThe submissions are autograded on a hidden test suite. The HW notebooks have some sample test cases but they usually are not comprehensive. i.e. passing the in-hw test cases does not mean the submission will get 100% marks from the autograder. Unfortunately, the autograder feedback is pretty unhelpful, so your best bet is to go to OH and get TA help.\n\ntl;dr: don't do autograder driven development, think about why your code isn't passing, and go to OH/ask on Piazza.\n\nMidterm:\nSun decided to institute a midterm for the first time ever in this course. The midterm was closed book, poorly written and not at all useful for us to demonstrate the knowledge we learned in the first half of the course.\n\nThe execution was poor: Sun only gave a 3 day window for scheduling the exam on ProctorU (1 hour). This is in stark contrast to other courses using ProctorU that typically give a 1 week window.\n\nThere was a practice exam and unfortunately it was not congruent with the actual exam.\n\ntl;dr: terrible experience, but at least consistent with the course's execution.\n\nReflection:\nEach week, there is required reading of a chapter in the new textbook, after which you write up to 2 page response to the reflection questions. These reflections are graded by 3 peers on the basis of 'effort.'\n\ntl;dr: students provide free labor to proofread Sun's new textbook.\n\nProject:\nThe idea is to replicate a recent deep learning paper (within 5 years it seems) in health care context. You can work in group of up to 3; some students went at it solo. The paper must be picked from a pool of papers that the TAs have reviewed. Do note that the TAs appear to review the papers for relevance, not necessarily for ease of reproducibility.\n\nThe main grading criteria is 'effort.' The TAs seem to be aware that it may not be possible to reproduce a paper exactly due to data being too big, expensive compute, software out of date, etc. In this case, you can try to reproduce the paper on a smaller subset of the data, use a smaller model, etc. All this is fine, but you must make very clear in your report about the different direction you take.\n\nUnfortunately, the course staff have been less than helpful in providing guidance for getting compute resources or how much money to spend on compute. You most likely will need to spend money out of pocket for the project.\n\nTip: spend a lot of time and effort in the paper selection. By effort, I mean to actually try to get the data the paper uses and see if you can even work with a subset of it. Basically don't be in the position where you commit to a paper and then find that you can't even access or work with the data it uses -- you need to find this out before the proposal stage.\n\ntl;dr: get a good group and recommend to start with Google Colab and pay for the Pro subscription ($10 USD/month).\n\nConclusion:\nThis course was a total zoo in execution. Frankly, I took this course because I needed a 500 level course for graduation, and in retrospect, I should have taken ABM.\n\nI suppose the main redeeming factors for this course are that:\n\n1) Deep learning is super popular now, so by taking this you at least have some idea about the basics like LSTM and attention. But not really any generative stuff which would be relevant for the Generative AI boom right now.\n2) The project can be very interesting and you can at least learn something from the experience, if you get lucky with the paper. (Again, the \"luck\" required is minimized with more effort to spend on exploring papers before selection.)HelpfulMediumStrongly Disliked7 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2024linkYou can probably coast through this course4/21/2024, 9:44 PMJust to give some context for my review, I'm a bit checked out of the program and am looking forward to graduating after the summer. So I was looking to put in as little effort as possible into this course while still achieving a passing grade. I also have done a little work with deep learning in the past but only in an academic (i.e. not professional or with much depth) setting. This review is for all the other slackers in the program looking to get a sense of the \"minimal\" effort needed to pass.\n\nFirst things first, I got through this course without ever watching a single lecture video or reading a single chapter. The only time I actually needed to put hours into the course was for doing homework (max 10 hours each, there were 5), reflections (30 min x 8 reflections), and the final project (guessing ~20 hours). If you do the math, conservatively speaking that's like ~75 hours over 15 weeks, so 5 hrs/week. I want to emphasize this is a conservative estimate, the actual number is probably lower. \n\nMore notes:\n\nFor the reflections you are supposed to \"read\" and summarize a chapter but really I only skimmed what I needed in order to form a few coherent sentences. And since reflections are peer-graded on \"effort\", this wasn't a problem. \n\nI did not love the fact that this semester there was a midterm, which as others have noted, was closed book and proctored. I didn't study so I just relied on my existing deep learning knowledge. I did fine. It's just 15% of the grade so no big deal. (HW 25%, reflections 20%, project 40%)\n\nThe difficulty of the final project is completely up to the paper you choose to reproduce, and may make or break your experience with this course. Things to keep in mind are code availability, code freshness (i.e. is it using outdated packages, software versions?), data availability (is the data publicly available?, is it large enough that you have to work with it on a machine that is not your laptop?).\n\nNeedless to say, I skipped anything optional, including quizzes, labs, lectures, and probably learning.HelpfulEasyNeutral5 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2024linkGood course that connects Deep Learning to Healthcare4/21/2024, 1:18 PMGreat course! However, this semester, a Midterm was added. Based on previous reviews, this was never the case. The Midterm was proctored and closed book. \n\nI would say as a full-time working professional, I spent about 20 - 30 hours a week on this course. The Professor and the TAs are/were working on a brand new book and thus weekly reflections were missed some weeks.HelpfulHardLiked25 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2024linkIf you want to learn deep learning, do NOT take this course4/19/2024, 9:53 AMTLDR:\n\n(1) Professor Jimeng Sun is either bad and irresponsible at teaching, or not skilled in deep learning. Or both.\n\n(2) If you take this course to learn deep learning, you have to spend a lot of time finding external resources and learn by yourself anyway.\n\n(3) The logistics of this course (grading, communication, timeline) is extremely chaotic.\n\n(4) The professor takes advantages of this students to be free-of-charge proofreaders of his new books.\n\n\n\n\nI took this course in spring 2024 because it is the only deep learning related course in the program. I saw negative ratings about this course before, but still decided to try it, not expecting it is even worse than what I have read.\n\n\nAbout course content:\n\nThis course is titled \"Deep learning for healthcare\". The emphasis of this course is indeed like that. Here is what a typical chapter looks like: The professor spends ~20 min talking about a particular deep learning model or technique (e.g., CNN), and then 30+ min on 2~4 papers using this model or technique in a healthcare application. More than half of the papers were published by Jiming Sun himself.\n\nI am a scientist in healthcare field. Some pioneering work in DL4H was indeed impressive, such as how GNN evolved to better model molecules. However, Sun does not talk about these. Instead, he focuses on his own work, which are far less impactful - just use an existing model and perform an application on a healthcare task, showing his performance is 5% better than previous methods. What do we learn from knowing this?\n\nSpeaking of deep learning, as you imagine, 20 minutes on CNN, 10 minutes on Transformer, etc., is not even enough to finish the introduction to these models. Yet that's all the time Sun spends on them. Many times, the flow of teaching is like deep learning model A consists of B, C, and D. B is xxx (1 min); C does xxx (2 min). D is xxx (1 min). Therefore, the model can do G (without introducing E and F). The textbook, written by the professor himself, has basically the same flow and same level of incompleteness. Thus, I had to find lots of external reading materials to understand the overall architecture of each model, as well as technical details of them, especially why you need some component, and how you implement it.\n\nHowever, that's not all. There are countless technical mistakes in his teaching contents, such as missing a term in the equation or having a plus sign instead of minus in the loss function (yet the professor goes through it without doubt). There is even one case in VAE that the professor points to a term that needs to be optimized, yet says this term can be viewed as a constant. It's understandable that there are occasional errors in teaching materials. However, it is unacceptable that Professor Sun is really unable to recognize them and can still talk about them \"logically\". This is extremely bad for students without deep learning basics. They learned something wrong, even worse than not learning.\n\n\nAbout the course experience:\n\nThe professor has zero engagement throughout the course. He never responds to a question on Piazza, even though some questions can only be answered by him. The grading rubrics are chaotic and keep changing throughout the course. For example, a mid-term is added to the course after it starts. No clarification on it (despite students keep asking) until 2 weeks before the exam date, which makes some students really hard to find time studying, or even schedule the exam within the 3-day window. Most students are full time working, yet the professor does not care about our work or life schedules.\n\nThe worst part of all is the reading reflection. We are supposed to write weekly reflections about the professor's new book, one chapter per week. The weekly reflections ask nothing about the technical understanding of the course material, but rather, \"What are the typos in this chapter?\", \"Which part do you think needs improvement?\", etc. This is simply taking advantage of students to be free labor to help him proofread. What do we learn by writing these reflections? None. Does the professor really tries to improve the book? I don't think so, otherwise there shouldn't still be so many mistakes in the textbook. It's a complete waste of time for all of us. \n\nInterestingly, this year, he (or his poor grad student) is writing a new book, but was unable to release the book on time. The reflection submission for week 8 was delayed, and delayed, and delayed. Some students get really frustrated because they need to write the stupid reflection to earn scores, but the professor does not care. He releases finally, before the deadline of the project draft submission. What a surprise.\n\nOverall, the professor does not respect his students. This is the bottom line. I have taken 6 courses so far. There were excellent professors like Professor Feng Liang (CS598 PSL), and of course there were professors on the other end of the spectrum, like Jimeng Sun.

This is why the lecture videos are a bit difficult to put your head around. \n\nThe assignments however are prefectly structured and very fairly graded. They introduce you to the healthcare data but sometimes you can solve them without understanding what each deep learning technique does to the fullest.\n\nThe final project is interesting but make sure you pick an interesting paper with available code, otherwise you're going to spend weeks on it.HelpfulMediumLiked8 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2023linkGood course in applications of deep learning.

If you do all of them, it's actually closer to 20 hours rather than 10! The quizzes and labs actually strengthen your understanding in deep learning and are very practical!

I chose a 2018 paper but it ended up to be a disaster due to compatibility issues, and didn't learn a whole lot on it. I would suggest picking something more recent and that's reproducible in authors code, so you don't have headaches dealing with old software and libraries that the authors use.\n\nI ended up with an A and as I thought 100% is an A+. If you want A+ do all extra credits!\n\nOverall, I think the professor can revise the class a bit:\n1. Make the lab and quizzes graded assignments with unlimited retries instead of optional.\n2. The weekly reflection is not necessary. Possibility make it in less frequency (e.g. pick 5 topics to read and research instead of having it weekly) as the textbook doesn't explain anything well for a deep learning beginner.\n3. For final reproduction projects, perhaps provide students a list of papers which the TAs have reproduced themselves and make them a guided approach that people can follow instead of exploring everything on our own.

I did not take AML as a pre-req, which made the beginning of the class a bit challenging but with the appropriate amount of time allocated to catching up in the beginning it is doable.  There are several components of this class including: labs, MPs, weekly reflections, and the paper reproduction.  \n\nLabs: not graded, but prepare you very well for the homework assignments.  I used these as a way of filling in the knowledge gaps for skipping the pre-reqs.  They do have a bit more in regards to the instructions than the MPs, but some of the same issues.  These are not graded, and could be skipped, but you will most likely waste more time in the MPs as a result.  \n\nMPs: these are 50% of your grade and where the bulk of the learning is taking place.  There is a lot of code you can take from one to the next for certain assignments, but be warned the instructions are not always super clear.  There are also transformations on the data that aren't well explained and only by going to office hours can be overcome (no answers in outside resources I could find).  A general clean up of the instructions would be helpful, but they do make you learn the differences between the different models.\n\nWeekly Reflections: these are 10% of your grade and mostly a box to be checked.  I did enjoy reading the resources others put in their reflections though!\n\nPaper Reproduction: this all depends on which paper as well as the partner you pick.  I ended up with an amazing partner who I worked well with on a paper that we could grasp technically.  We learned a lot, but did spend a bit of money on resources.  The grading seems to require closely following the rubric, so keep an eye on that.  Also the rubrics tend to be posted on a Campuswire post, so make sure to save the link when it comes out.HelpfulHardLiked15 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2023linkFocused on applications over core concepts5/8/2023, 6:23 AMThis course provides some knowledge on various types of neural networks, but its main focus is on applying them to solve real-world medical problems. If this is your very first course in neural networks or deep learning, as it was mine, you may struggle unless you peruse outside resources.\nThere are no graded exams/quizzes for this course. The \"weekly\" assignment is to write a 1 to 2 page reflection on that week's textbook chapter. These are extremely easy as they are peer graded based on effort, and some people turned these into note sheets, but it also seems like a juvenile assignment for a 500-level class.\nThe coding labs and homework were the best way to learn the material. I honestly never struggled with the limited amount of submissions: all you need to do is give yourself as much of a headstart as possible, then stop and consult Campuswire if you hit a wall. TAs this semester were a lot more involved and helpful than the reviews from the last semester indicate. I do agree with the person who talked about the homework being a \"tensor manipulation bootcamp\" at times, as 99% of the time, my issues did not lie with my models, but because tensors were not in the right shape or format.\nThe final project is 40% of your grade and is quite intensive, requiring a written report, code submission, and a presentation video. You do get ample time to complete it. As others have warned, be thorough and take your time on paper selection. I chose one that looked straightforward and had small, publicly available datasets. But it turned out to not have existing code anywhere, missing implementation details, and confusing, outright contradictory statements. This is not the end of the world, though, as it's okay if you cannot reproduce the paper. You just have to be able to explain convincingly why you could not, and still have code of your best attempt to show for it.\nOverall, this is an interesting course that tests your understanding quite effectively with the final project, but I would definitely supplement it with additional learning materials.HelpfulMediumLiked5 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2023linkDecent class5/7/2023, 10:05 AMThe grading was composed of the following:\n50%: 5 homeworks (Jupyter notebook in coursera) @ 10% each.\n10% (Weekly reflection, every week from week 1 to 12)\n40% (4% proposal, 8% draft, 20% write-up, 4% presentation, 4% code).\nThere was also 9% optional extra credit given (5% through book reviews, 4% in the final), so you could theoretically get a 109% in the class, which seems a bit ridiculous. \n\nThe TAs were solid this semester and did a good job answering questions quickly and accurately. The TAs and prof seemed very engaged and interested in the course material too. As other reviewers pointed out, some of the homework instructions were not clear. Often it made sense to wait for other students to get jammed up first on the homework and see their questions answered in campuswire, and that could save you a lot of time (and submission attempts). \n\nSome students complained about the limit of 5 submissions per homework, but I felt it was pretty manageable. There was only one part of one homework I didn't get a 100% on (since I ran out of submissions), and I didn't care that much. I felt the homeworks were easy, but did require a little thought. Some of the code you could copy directly from the labs, if you did them. \n\nA lot of the time for (some) students was spent on the final project. As other reviewers have pointed out, choose your project wisely. I'd also add: choose one with a very small dataset. I had fun with the final project, that was where I got to learn some stuff. However, I felt the homework you could hack your way through without learning much. \n\nNot having exams in this class was great.

Each video was about 30-40 minutes and, in my opinion, they were all useless. The videos barely talked about fundamental concepts, rarely explained them, and also lacked a lot of examples and additional information that could have helped understand the topics a lot better. The professor would literally read line by line from his textbook during the recorded lectures and just graze over the topic and move on to the next. I found myself relying more on outside resources to learn the material rather than the lectures and textbook.\n\nI would also ask questions on Piazza only to have them ignored until the last minute, or until a student attempted to help. In the rare occasion where the TA would respond, I would almost always get conflicting responses from them. One TA would tell me to do something and then another TA would tell me not to do that thing. This got really frustrating when working on the final project.\n\nThe course consisted of weekly reflections, five homework assignments, and a final group project. The weekly reflections were nothing special. They were peer graded assignments that pretty much helped the professor edit his textbook. The assignments could have been interesting but they were all plug and chug. Each assignment was also limited to 5 submissions which was extremely annoying because all of the assignments had poorly written instructions and horrible/vague assertions which rarely helped debug issues. At times I would pass all the visible test cases but failed the hidden test cases when submitting. I spent roughly 3-4 hours/week on the homework assignments.\n\n\nThe Final Project:\n\nThe group project was a replication project. It could have been really interesting if it wasn't so disorganized. I understand that this was the first time they created a project like this but there could have been many ways it could have been improved. The instructors provided a list of papers that we could reproduce and rated each by difficulty. The difficulty was related to the model that was described in the paper, not the overall replication process which was really misleading. Some papers listed as easy had no source code and provided insufficient information about replication making it nearly impossible to use. My group had to switch through 3 \u201ceasy\u201d papers because of the lack of information or because the dataset that they used was not publicly available. I thought that the instructors would have removed such papers from the list since it took them a month and a half to release the list of papers and the project instructions. \n\nAgain, the instructors were really bad at helping explain the poorly written project instructions. Many students would ask questions regarding what was required for each check point throughout the project process, only to have the TAs answer days or hours before something was due. Again the instructors would provide conflicting answers. Some TAs would say replicate some baseline models or show your face in the recording and then another would say create all baseline models and don't use your face. We would only get the finalized answer literally a day or two before something was due. Questions would pile up and TAs would just ignore them (There are still 50+ unresolved questions and follow-ups on Piazza regarding just the final project).\n\nMy advice to future students:\n- Start the homework assignments as soon as they are released\n- Find a paper that has code and the dataset readily available\n- If you have to request access to the dataset, do it really really early (especially for MIMIC-III data)\n- Work in a group, not aloneHelpfulHardDisliked10 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkGood for execution and concepts, not good for DL basics5/26/2022, 8:18 AM(+) I learned about DL architectures, and now have reference material for the concepts thanks to writing about them in weekly reflection assignments. However, these scribbles are as good as you make them. Graded by peer review with \"made an effort\" guidelines.\n\n(+) Finishing the project makes you feel like a superhero--depending on your paper-to-replicate selection, you have potential to build something very practical and cutting edge. Very cool, and definitely not a \"toy\" accomplishment like is so common in classes.

Would say this was useful.\n\n(-) I don't feel like I can \"do\" DL from scratch yet, even after an A in this class. If I was to try for ML Engineering positions in industry, I'd have to re-learn the details of many core concepts. The course did touch on this, but the grading approach did not require learning the details concepts, and outside resources are essential.\n\n(-) The textbook covered many topics briefly and densely. The early chapters (introductory, effectively not-DL) were well paced, but the rest quickly (d)evolved into walls of math that didn't feel at all clearly explained. I'd wager most of this is quite good for an experienced DL researcher to review from, but misses in a class where prior DL experience is stated as not required.\n\n(\u2022) The course seems set up with industry applications in mind.  I suppose hence the \"for healthcare\" in the name. While the class tries to fill the role of an intro course, it does this poorly. However, it's an excellent class for someone with strong DL foundations or someone just seeking conceptual takeaways.\n\n(\u2022) Hours spent filled in arbitrarily.

I have learnt a lot about healthcare applications and deep learning algorithms. The weekly reflections really help consolidate my knowledge. Homework is quite time-consuming and requires me to dig down into the code to understand the whole concept. The final project really forces me to review many healthcare papers and learn PostgreSQL on the go to clean the data. To get the most from this course, you also need to be curious enough to go beyond the provided assignments and take time to understand the codes and research topics.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked12 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkSlow start, strong Finish5/21/2022, 3:17 PMIn comparison to the reviews from 2021, this class has likely changed quite a bit. The textbook is finished and available, though some people in the course did not like the approach taken with it. \n\nIt's one of the few courses where I actually finished reading the entire textbook (partially due to the requirement of reviewing chapters and partially due to the lower density of pure math equations). Point of fact, you will need to supplement your technical understanding with online resources.\n\nThe MPs overall are easy, but there are some typos along the way, which can be frustrating. I do think the extra bit of struggle in this case could be beneficial in retaining concepts, but it's definitely weird to think it was done on purpose.\n\nThe TAs were great and helpful, though office hours were limited due to the class being completely full.\n\nThe final project is where you get most of the juice for this class. Paper reproduction taught me 100+ little things during the entire process.\n\nMy 11.5 hr weekly workload is actually an average if you are able to spread it out evenly, but the proper range was closer to 8 to 23 hrs.\n\nThe breakdown of hours was 36% on Content+Quizzes+Reviews, 26% on MPs and 38% of time on the final project (not counting any model training time, which was mostly done overnight).\n\nIf the final project process is repeated at the next offering, my only suggestion is to pick something with an available code base, reasonable data size and reasonable computation time to be able to run as many experiments as you wish. Many people spent their entire final project data wrangling or even just trying to acquire data rather than working on their specific topic of learning.\n\nGrade: A+HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked11.5 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkAverage Course5/17/2022, 12:40 AMOverall\n- The coursework load is medium, but to actually learn, putting in many extra hours aside from the graded assignments is necessary.\n\nRegarding Learning\n- To learn actual machine learning concepts in the course, you have to put in the work yourself. Not much actual learning can be accomplished if you only do the homework assignments, which are just Jupyter notebook exercises and reading reflections.\n- The labs are very educational and high quality compared to the homework and great for learning, but they are not graded.\n\nRegarding Assignment Difficulty\n- The homework assignments could be difficult during debugging. Takes occassionally going to office hours or doing  a lot of investigative work to unblock.\n- Final project is reproducing a healthcare machine learning study. The difficulty depends on how careful you are with selecting a project that is easily reproducible with easily accessible data and/or code.\n- Final project grading practices for this course are completely based on how good you are at fulfilling all criteria spread out through several rulbrics. If you fail to miss one criterion, you get points off and won't get them back. However, you can submit regrade if there is a mistake in grading.HelpfulMediumNeutral5 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkHealthcare focus was interesting, but teaching on deep learning was poor5/16/2022, 6:36 PMThis course is the only one in the MCS program which covers deep learning. I was excited initially, but very disappointed at the end.\n\nThe course was heavily focused on healthcare data, and this was interesting. What it really lacked was the teaching on various concepts in deep learning itself. The weekly video lecture was very shallow as it only ran 30 mins to an hour on average, and the associated chapter in the book was only 10-20 pages long. Lots of fundamental concepts in deep learning were mostly touched on at the surface, and the explanation on forward and backward prop etc were mostly missing. I also found some of the explanation in the video and the book confusing and misleading. What I ended up doing was to study the \"Deep Learning Specification\" from DeepLearning.AI on Coursera in parallel; I learned 10x as much from the speciialization alone, and this course suddenly became a walk in the park. I spent about 25-30 hours/week for the Deep Learning specialization and managed to complete it in five weeks. On the other hand, I generally spent 2-3 hours/week in this course on the lecture, book, and weekly reflection, plus an additional 4-8 hours per HW.\n\nThe group project to reproduce a research paper was challenging, but it was mostly due to logistic issues. For example, many research papers didn't use public dataset meaning they were not reproducible in the first place. It was also very difficult for students to reproduce a research paper without existing code available, as most research papers didn't not provide sufficient information for reproducibility from scratch. It was unclear to me why the professor provided these papers in the list for students to easily shot themselves in the foot.\n\nMy advices to future students on the group project would be\n1) Ensure dataset is available and accessible.\n2) Request access to the dataset as early as possible.\n3) Ensure there are existing code.\n4) Ensure you try running the existing code early to check if the code is complete and actually works.\n5) Ensure the computation requirements for running the code are reasonable, otherwise you might end up spending days or even weeks to compute the baselines.\n\nThe interactions with the instructors barely existed. Sure, some TAs were helpful in answering some questions, but overall the professor did not participate in Piazza much at all. It was quite common that questions in the forum went unanswered for days. I did not go to office hours so I don't think it's fair for me to comment on that.\n\nOverall, if you really want to have Deep Learning under your belt as part of the MCS program, sure you can take this course. However, be prepared to spend lots of time pulling your hairs in self-study on deep learning fundamentals, as the lecture and book won't teach you much.HelpfulHardDisliked12 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkWould be great if the instructor cared5/16/2022, 12:20 PMThis course has so much potential.  There were so many times I enjoyed what I was learning and I knew I could apply it to my job as I am in the healthcare industry but the HWs and Projects are extremely frustrating.  The insturctions aren't clear so you have to rely on asking others for help and reading comments from other to figure out what is actually being required.  The data manipulation steps in each HW require you to go through a bootcamp in manipulating tensors rather than giving you other ways to clean the data.  The modeling steps in the homework were normally pretty easy and easiest portion of it.  The final project was very open ended and there was little guidance or helped offered.  I had sent questions directly to the instructors via Piazza and did not receive a response.  I also sent emails to the instructors and received no response on a couple of occasions. The instructors made it sound like they had the ability to get us access to a database very quickly but then it still took a month to receive access.\n\nIf I were to take this course again, I would make sure to do the following things.\n\nCreate a study group where you can talk about was is required in each homework.\n\nChoose a paper that is relatively easy and that you understand fully.\n\nGet access to MIMIC III as soon as the project is announced. \n\nDo not procrastinate and do the assignments as soon as they come out.HelpfulHardDisliked18 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkUtterly Disappointing5/16/2022, 8:09 AMCould've easily learned more about deep learning from good MOOCs online.

As of this writing, the university considers this course an unofficial capstone in the subject.  Students do not need previous experience in the subject to succeed in the course, but prior experience in machine learning will be very helpful and strongly advised.\n\nTopics (not exhaustive):\n- Health Data Standards\n- Prediction/classification methods\n- Deep Neural Network\n- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n- AutoEncoder\n- Graph Neural Network (GNN)\n- Attention Models\n- Memory Networks\n- General Adversarial Network (GAN)\n- Variational AutoEncoder\n\nNOTE: variations of each of the above models specialized for medical data are covered too.\n\nThis was the 2nd offering of the course, and there were some changes compared to the 1st offering in spring 2021.  Namely, additional programming assignments, and the final course project was both changed and expanded.  More on that later.\n\nThe course was taught by professor Dr. Jimeng Sun, who previously taught Georgia Tech and worked at IBM.  He is quite knowledgeable about the subject of deep learning, but can be very stubborn when it comes to logistics of the course such as deadlines, grades, and correcting mistakes in the material.  Although course communications were conducted on Piazza, he was a rare participant, and did not acknowledge private messages sent through that forum.  You had to contact him in instructor office hours or email.\n\nThe course consists of the following:\n- video lectures (60-90 minutes per week)\n- textbook reading (~20 pages per week)\n- weekly reflection with peer review to discuss what you understand of the material, answer a few questions, and grade your classmates.\n- 4 labs (not graded)\n- weekly quizzes (not graded)\n- 5 homework assignments (spread across 11 jupyter notebooks)\n- course project (work alone or with 1 partner)\n- no exams\n\nPolicies:\n- Late work not accepted.\n- Communications on Piazza.com\n- Sign up list for office hours.  First come, first serve according to the sign up list.\n\nGrading:\n   10% weekly reflections\n   50% homework assignments\n   40% course project.\n\n*Grading scale not released until all work submitted and graded (cutoff for an A was tentatively set at 95%)\n\n\nUnlike most courses at UIUC which provide material for the full semester, this course only provides material through the first 12 weeks.  The last few weeks of the course are spent solely on the course project.\n\nThe course material is derived from the textbook written by the professor focusing primarily on the high-level concepts related to deep learning, while the nuts and bolts of the implementation are left to the programming assignments.  The textbook does contain the theory/formulas for the various deep learning algorithms, but they can be difficult to follow without a coded example to illustrate the point.  The textbook gives a decent amount of coverage of deep learning models used in health care, but they should be considered high-level overviews, not exhaustive descriptions.  Students are expected to conduct their own research on the topics to supplement their understanding of the material.  One very big downside to the textbook is it is loaded with typographical errors and poor/awkward use of grammar making for a difficult read at times.  There are enough errors that you sometimes don't fully trust the material even when you understand it.\n\nThe weekly lecture videos are mostly broad summaries of the textbook material.  They cover the general ideas of the lesson, but the finer details are in the textbook readings.  Most students watched the videos first, the followed up with the readings.  Video lectures for most weeks was approximately 60 minutes in duration, but some weeks had as much as 120 minutes.\n\nEach week include a 'weekly reflection' which is where the student must summarize what they learned during that week's lesson, and also answer a few questions posed by the professor.  After submitting the weekly reflection, students then grade at least 3 other weekly reflections from classmates.  Scoring was fairly lenient only deducting points for gross errors.  By the 3rd week everybody was in form and completing the assignments as expected with very few deductions.\n\nThe first few weeks of the course are fairly light as students get acclimated.  The first few lessons are general overview of the health industry, terminology used in deep learning, and the most basic concept of how deep learning works.  During these light weeks, it is suggested students spend time on the labs which are interspersed in the course calendar on Coursera.  The labs are mini-programming assignments illustrating a concept that will come later in the homework assignment.  For example, how to perform a training of a deep neural network.  how to compute scores such as accuracy, area under curve (AUC), and loss.  The labs are not graded, but allow you to get acclimated on the subject so the homework assignments do not overwhelm.  They also help you form questions to ask the TAs during office hours.\n\nHomework:\n\nThe homework assignments are the meat of the course, and consume a great deal of time.  Like CS 441 Applied Machine Learning, the assignments are represented as Jupyter notebooks where the student fills in the blanks, but unlike CS 441, there are multiple notebooks per assignment, and you do need to read the textbook to know how to do it.  There is a lot more understanding of linear algebra and programming required to complete the assignments.  Assignments primarily use PyTorch augmented with Numpy.  Other libraries are included as needed (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), but students don't interact with them too much.  The first assignment covers the basics of deep learning, such as how to evaluate the training results using scores, interpreting loss, and so on.  The middle assignments are the most time consuming as they cover the most common algorithms used in the industry (CNN, RNN, ...).  The later assignments are more or less repeats of earlier assignments in terms of format.   One big challenge to the homework was lack of clarity of the instructions embedded in the notebooks.  Like the textbook, they are full of typographical errors, and are quite terse.  Most of the times student got stuck was because of unclear instructions, not because they did not understand the math.  Once the instructions became clear, students were generally able to complete the assignments on their own.  Finally, each assignment was allowed a maximum of 5 submission attempts.  In most cases I succeeded on the first attempt as did many other students.  But occasionally you'd need the 2nd or 3rd attempt when you made stupid mistakes.  The lesson is to debug your code before you submit and do not rely on the auto-grader to find the problems for you.\n\nCourse project:\n\nThe original offering of the course curated a small number of papers and divided into teams of 4 students each.  Teams would pick one of the curated papers, implement it, then report on the findings.   This time around the course project was a bit different as a very large pool of papers was provided (312), many of which were not fully vetted.  Students were allowed to work alone or with one other classmate as a team.  Teams had to choose a paper from the pool, implement it, verify the claims of the paper, then try to improve the results.  There were opportunities to earn extra points for working on a paper with higher difficulty and/or performing ablations to investigate other areas outside of the paper.  In practice, the scope of work varied greatly as the TAs only curated the deep learning portion of the paper (i.e. ensured the algorithms in the paper were within the scope of what we learned in the course).   The other requirements, such as data wrangling, were left unchecked.  It was the responsibility of the students to determine if a given paper was viable within the course schedule.  Many papers had big surprises, depended on resources that were not available (data, code, ...), or required heavy investments of time that were not obvious from the descriptions in the paper.  Some teams were able to complete their projects fairly quickly while others struggled mightily to meet the bare minimum requirements due to unforeseeable complications.  Either way, it was certainly an eye opening experience to the amount of preparation required before you can do deep learning.  For example, my teams' project had very heavy data aggregation and cleaning requirements occupying 90% of the project schedule leaving only a few days for actual deep learning.  This robbed us of the opportunity to perform ablations and other studies of interest.\n\nI was fortunate enough to work with a good teammate who complemented me very well, but my first choice did not work out so well as he/she was not willing to invest the necessary time to do the job well, and/or was incapable of some of the tasks required to implement the paper.  Therefore, if there is any word of advice for the course project, it is this:  vet both your teammate as well as your paper very deeply before settling on your selection.  Your teammate's willingness/ability is probably a better predictor of project outcome than the paper you choose.  The paper you choose will often have hidden requirements you cannot know about until you attempt to implement it.  Therefore, any time invested in investigating the project requirements (and ensuring you can obtain/meet them) will be time very well spent.  For example, if a paper requires a particular data set, make sure you can actually get your hands on the data set before you commit to the paper.  In our project, we could not get the data and had to use an alternate data set, which turned out to be insufficient, forcing us to choose a 2nd data set and effectively start over.\n\nOffice hours:\n\nThe TAs were generally very good compared to other courses.  I was able to get meaningful help from every one of them at one point or another.  However, the office hours format was a complete joke and probably one of the bigger black eyes to this course.  To obtain help in office hours required the use of a sign-up sheet on a first come, first serve basis.  Didn't matter if you showed up first on zoom, if your name wasn't on the list, or was at the back of the list, you had to wait for everybody to get their turn before your named was called.  On paper this is a perfectly fine and organized way to do things, but in practice is a complete fiasco as many students 'squatted' the list by signing up for every available session of the semester effectively blocking students who genuinely needed the help from getting help.  For example, during one of the homeworks I was stuck because the instructions were unclear.  I just needed clarity, but I wasn't getting a timely response on Piazza.  By the time I was able to sign up for office hours, I was 15th in line and had to wait until the end of the session only for the TA to say time has run our for that session - this happened 3 days in a row.  Meanwhile, the students at the front of the line (the squatters) didn't really need help and were asking frivolous questions similar to 'what's the meaning of love'?  but in context of the course materials.  Several students were disenfranchised in this manner.  Waiting in line wouldn't be so bad if you could see the help other students were getting, but unfortunately, breakout rooms were used for every student, so waiting in line amounted to watching a blank screen for lengths of time until your name was called.  After a number of students bitched, the format was changed so the sign-up list was policed.  Students were allowed to attend any office hours they wanted, but if they wanted priority help, they needed to use the sign-up sheet, and were limited to 2 sign-ups per week.  Breakout rooms were still used, but only if the student receiving help requested it.  This allows the more trivial aspects, such as getting clarity on assignment instructions, be answered and benefit more students in less time.  Another downside to the TA office hours schedule was all the sessions were clumped at the end of the week.  There was no help whatsoever from Saturday through Wednesday afternoon.  If you were stuck on the homework, or needed help with anything else, you had to plan your time wisely.\n\nKeys to success:\n\n- Do watch video lectures before reading the textbook.\n- Do the labs before attempting the homework assignments.\n- Do visit office hours frequently, even if you feel comfortable about the material.\n- Do **very deeply** research the requirements for the course project before settling on a paper to implement.  Time invested on this task will not be wasted, and will likely make or break your project.  \n- Do vet your teammate's skill set and capacity to do work if you choose to work with one.  This often predicts the outcome more than the paper of choice.\n\n- Do NOT procrastinate.  The schedule is tight with very little wiggle room, and the instructor is very strict about deadlines.  You will NOT get sympathy if you're late.HelpfulMediumLiked15 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2022linkGreat course, takes some personal investment5/9/2022, 7:36 PMGood class. Don't be put off by \"for healthcare\"; those aspects are pretty superficial and the main content is all about deep learning. Course has its warts, but if you're willing and able to put in time and effort it is easily worth it. After all if you're looking to do DS/ML you *need* to have a strong base in deep learning. If you're in software it's still a great tool to know.\n\n\n#### Weekly Material ####\nWeekly responsibilities consist of lecture videos, a chapter from the textbook, a written reflection on the material (an outline & answers to some specific questions), and an optional quiz. \n\nThe textbook is written by the professor. Unfortunately there is a lot of competing material out there on explaining deep learning fundamentals, and the book is just not competitive. That said, it isn't meant to be. The book also talks about healthcare data, applications in healthcare, and case studies involving deep learning models. These are the bright spots of the book and are genuinely useful. But definitely do not rely solely on the book. I didn't actually use the lecture videos but I presume they aren't enough either, given their length. I would strongly encourage seeking out other sources and spending time understanding the concepts. \n\nSimilarly I'd also urge you to take the reflection seriously. They are peer-reviewed so I've seen a lot of reflections from other students, and I think most were very lacking. Take notes! Invest your time! Do research! \n\nOTOH I didn't like the quizzes and stopped doing them halfway. The questions felt shallow and nitpicky rather than thoughtful. Hopefully they improve so that they encourage students to take their time with the material.\n\n\n#### Homeworks ####\nThere were 5 homeworks. Standard fill-in-the-blanks Jupyter notebooks. Everything is Pandas/Numpy/Pytorch. I think they did a reasonable job with the homeworks and avoided the trap of having them be too trivial (looking at you, AML). HW material is suitably interesting too. You're not developing toy models or writing backprop from scratch for the nth time, but reproducing actual architectures from recent publications. However, at times the instructions were vague, which could be frustrating. This was the worst with HW1 though, so hopefully this continues to improve as the course develops. \n\nOne thing to note is that you have only 5 submissions to the autograder. I understand why this is controversial, and it certainly puts on some pressure, but it really wasn't too bad. The worst for me was 3 submissions once.  Most of the time 1 was enough. I think it's a fair decision to force students to learn how to test and debug, and not use the autograder as a crutch.\n\n\n#### Final Project #### \nFor Spring 2022 we had to pick from a list of papers involving deep learning in healthcare, and reproduce it. (I understand this is a different project from the 2021 incarnation of the course, so maybe this will change.) Deliverables were the codebase, a final writeup, and a short (4min) presentation. It was okay to reference publicly available code. \n\nI found this to be a highly rewarding project. I came out the other end with a strong knowledge of Pytorch fundamentals, experience with the practical issues around tuning and training models, an impressive final product, and confidence that I could read and implement cutting-edge research. \n\nHOWEVER, be very careful in picking a paper! Choosing a reproducible paper is a significant challenge. Many of my peers struggled with finding a paper with accessible data, well-explained methods, and/or a publicly available codebase. The instructors' restrictions on paper selection made this process a mess too - a lot of the papers on the list they provided were not reasonably reproducible. Ideally that will improve if there is a next time. But my advice is to invest a lot of time in reviewing and selecting your paper - it will pay off in spades.HelpfulHardLiked8 hrs/wk", "Deep Learning for HealthcareSpring 2021linkMuch needed Deep learning course but room for improvement1/28/2022, 7:24 AMCourse videos and content was well designed and overall a good course in general.

Despite that the grading standard is strict where reasonable replies would still receive no credit, there is a noticeable lack of TA support for homework-related inquiries on Campuswire. Even when questions were replied by an anonymous student with wrong answers, no TA intervened to provide official clarification while they just marked the questions to be \"resolved\". This neglect is especially problematic given the frequent ambiguities in the homework. As a result, we 3-credit students are often left to guess the graders' expectations with the little help that we can gain which makes the grades of HWs especially frustrating.\nSometimes what we learn in class doesn\u2019t match up with the homework solutions. Like in one of the HW, the official method we were taught only got partial credit.\nOften in campuswire, TAs' replies tell us to consider certain things that end up to be the opposite in the actual grading. This has really confused me and honestly, it's stressful every time I see the grading criteria and I know a lot of students are complaining about this. These kinds of controversy keep happening, and it's super frustrating to argue with TAs through regrade requests where they usually just brush it off by saying my solution is 'sub-optimal' without explaining why.\nAll the things added up made me feel that they just want to take off your scores. I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to take the spring version of this course.HelpfulMediumStrongly Disliked6 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkRigorous CS course12/31/2023, 8:27 PMInstructor: Gupta, Indranil (Indy)\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is only relevant for the Fall 2023 iteration and may not hold for future iterations.\n\nWeekly Time Breakdown:\nTotal: 136.72 hr, Mean: 8.04 hr, Min: 0.82 hr, Max: 16.7 hr, SD: 3.9 hr\n\nBackground:\n- 6th course in the MCS program\n- Only course this term\n- Full time Software engineer (> 5 YoE)\n- Employer covering tuition\n\nI took this course as I had not taken a formal course in distributed systems.\n\nGrade Breakdown:\n- 20% Weekly Quizzes\n- 9% Final Quizzes (2x)\n- 13% Programming Assignments (2x)\n- 26% Homeworks (4x)\n- 10% Midterm Exam\n- 22% Final Exam\n\nMaterial:\nThe course is a survey course covering various topics in distributed systems. It's divided into two parts. The first part covers topics like MapReduce, Gossip, Failure Detection, KV-Stores, Time Synchronization, and Ordering. The second part covers topics like Multicast Ordering, Consensus, Leader Election, Mutual Exclusion, Concurrency Control, and light treatment of File Systems, Security, and outage case studies topics.\n\nLectures:\nAll lectures are given by Indy. The slides and videos on Coursera haven't been updated for some time, so there may still be errors in the slides. In this case, I would recommend cross-referencing with the slides given to students in the in-person version of this course. Also, the in-person lectures are recorded and the recordings can be useful to review on occasion if the corresponding Coursera lecture is not clear. Generally, the Coursera lectures match up with the on-campus version, with MapReduce examples being a notable exception.\n\nThe lecture slides by themselves are incomplete; you need to also watch the lecture video to glean the additional material to complete the slides.\n\nThere's a textbook for the course by Coulouris et al. It is challenging to read but can be a useful reference if you have the time to peruse it.\n\nThere is typically 1-2 hours of lecture each week. Not too heavy but you will likely need additional time to re-watch certain parts and take notes.\n\nSupport:\nThis is the first course I took that uses Piazza instead of Campuswire. Piazza is miles better. Indy is quite responsive on Piazza, and more so than the TAs, in my view. However, student reading comprehension was sometimes poor (a problem not unique to this course), so Indy's responses tended to have condescending/passive-aggresive vibes.\n\nBoth TAs and Indy hold office hours. But, not much comment on office hours as I did not attend any. However, from what I have heard, OHs are not well run. Students enter a Zoom waiting room and the TA sees each student individually. But this waitlist is completely opaque to waiting students, and it was often the case that OH ended with students still waiting.\n\nQuizzes:\nThey are your usual weekly Coursera quizzes usually due the week they first appear. Unlimited attempts, and some questions change after each attempt, so recommend attempting the quizzes multiple times.\n\nThere are two final quizzes, one due at the end of each part of the course. These are longer and are untimed, but only allow two attempts.\n\nHomeworks:\nThe HWs are done solo. There were four of them in this semester, and usually had 2-3 weeks to complete them. The HW are written and you submit a PDF of your typed-out solutions to Gradescope. You can use LaTeX / MS Word / etc.\n\nUnlimited submissions allowed before the deadline.\n\nThe HW problems are rather substantial and require time to review and think about the lecture material. The problems are more of the theoretical nature, and you will need to write out your reasoning clearly and sometimes provide a proof. You really want to start early on the HW.\n\nProgramming Assignments:\nThere were two assignments this semester. 1) Membership protocol 2) KV-store. Both assignments are done individually and are in C++. I hadn't touched C++ for a long time so the first assignment took more time than the second. I would say if you are coming from Python, then you should learn/review these C++ concepts: pointer arithmetic, copy vs reference, and pointer dereferencing.\n\nI learned a lot about doing these assignments but I feel that there could have been more assignments because technically speaking, these two assignments could be solved with the material from only the first part of the course.\n\nTip: these assignments are not to be confused with the MPs that the on-campus students are required to do.\n\nExams:\nI have to say that Indy is a real G with how he has set up the exams. Apparently, students in the prior year's offering (FA2022) had issues with ProctorU and the midterm, so he removed the ProctorU requirement for the final. Indy has continued the pattern this semester with no ProctorU for the exams.\n\nBoth the midterm and final are open book and are done on Gradescope. Basically, when you open the exam on Gradescope, a timer starts, and you will be able to download a PDF with the questions. You need to type up your answers and submit a PDF to Gradescope before the timer expires. I'd recommend using MS Word due to the time crunch.\n\nMidterm covers material from the first part of the course. The timer was 100 minutes. It was pretty straightforward, and you get a practice midterm exam. The difficulty is similar to that in the HWs.\n\nFinal covers material from the whole course, emphasis on the second part. The timer was 210 minutes. No practice exam was provided - only thing Indy said was the final is same format but proportionally longer. It was tough, the questions were basically the same type as the hardest HW problems. Doing these problems as if they were HW would likely take several hours, so you'll need to solve them really fast for the final. Thus, the final really tests your understanding of the material.\n\nTo prepare for the exams, review the lectures and the homeworks. Then the quizzes.\n\nTip: use MS Word and make sure that you can save the document as PDF before taking the exam.\n\nConclusion:\nThe course is a good introduction to various topics in Distributed Systems. Indy puts effort into teaching the course and has time for Coursera students on top of the on-campus students he teaches. You will get out of the course what you put into it.\n\nThis course is also one of the hardest I have taken in the program thus far, but I liked it as it felt the closest in rigor comparable to the CS courses taken in my undergrad.\n\nJust like other courses in the program, this one is also in the \"mile wide, inch deep\" coverage of the topics. I thought the first part and the first half of the second part of the course were good. Beyond that, the material was pretty lacking and not at all really reinforced through HW or programming assignments. To be fair, the pattern also holds for the other courses I've taken in this program.\n\nI'd also say that this course is strictly inferior to the on-campus version, where students get to work on four MPs that actually involve multiple machines and are more \"distributed systems\" than the two programming assignments on Coursera. Material wise, this course is good, but the hands-on programming aspect is definitely lacking.\n\nP.S. The student review dated 2023-12-06 is for the on-campus version, so the MP comments should be ignored for the Coursera students reading this.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked8 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkFantastic, practical, and tough class12/21/2023, 7:30 PMPros - excellent class with relevant, modern concepts. Wonderful prep for system design interviews, and course organization is efficient and has clearly been refined over time. Professor & TAs respond quickly on Campuswire. And though grading is stressful because it's curved and final exam grades aren't released, grades seem to be fairly distributed (got an A- despite a mediocre midterm grade and a total unknown final exam grade).\n\nCons - though Prof Indy is knowledgeable and engaging, his attitude toward the online MCS section is frequently condescending. He responds to Campuswire posts quickly but rarely provides useful responses - the vast majority are passive aggressive comments that link to prior posts that are related, but don't address the poster's question. It's extremely frustrating to get repeated comments telling you to look at post #642 when your question is about the same topic, but specifically on an edge case not discussed in #642.\n\nAs mentioned above, grading is stressful but fair. Final grade distributions and final exam grades aren't released, and median grades are only released for some assignments (like the midterm and the 4 homework assignments). As a result, I had no idea what grade to expect until it was released. In hindsight, grading seems fair, but I do wish there was more transparency.\n\nMPs are challenging but wonderful opportunities to learn. Yes, the starter code is tricky - it's meant to model a real distributed network. Yes, most classes in this program don't require C/C++ programming, and dealing with memory issues is a unique challenge - but no one should be graduating with a Masters in Computer Science without knowing how memory management works. Expect to spend 15+ hours on each of the two MPs.\n\nStill one of the best classes I've taken. It's not the easiest 'A' and it won't give you a low stress semester, but you'll learn.HelpfulVery HardLiked15 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkGood introduction to distributed systems12/21/2023, 5:22 PMThis was the hardest course I've taken and not sure if it was really worth it. It is a good introduction to distributed systems and I learned a lot but this course covers too many topics and doesn't really go in depth. \n\nI might have been better off taking an easier course and just reading a book on distributed systems. The reason I'm not too fond of this course was because of the stress from grading and this being my last course before graduating - I needed a B- to get credit. Unfortunately, they don't give you a grading scale so you have no idea what grade you have all semester, though they do give you average/median grades for certain assignments. And the curve at the end seemed to be generous. \n\nI got an A- with the following grades:\nQuizzes: 100% (unlimited attempts so free points)\nFinal Quiz: 90% avg for both (These are un-timed and you get 2 attempts, should be essentially free points)\nMPs: These were so difficult - almost considered not doing them but I got it to work in the end. Got a 100 on the first MP and around a 95 on the second.\nHW: they're pretty difficult but they do solidify lecture knowledge. I had a lot of points taken off on couple of the HWs, i requested a regrade and got lots of points back. Averaged a 90 on the HWs.\nExams: They're hard because of the time constraint but at least they're open book. Got a 70ish on the first exam. They don't release second exam grades but I probably got like a 60 or so.HelpfulHardNeutral15 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkQuality material and well organized12/14/2023, 9:37 AMThis was a quality course that was well organized. By the end you'll feel confident about being able to meaningfully contribute (as a noob, but still) to the inner workings of the major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. More specifically, you'll end up with a good understanding of how to coordinate a distributed system (i.e., a bunch of computers working together to create a flexible and fault-tolerant system).\n\nIf (and this is a big if), you have a good software engineering background and are at least familiar with C++, the MPs really aren't that bad. There's only two of them, and they only took a couple days for me to get working. To be sure, not everyone had that experience, so take that with a grain of salt. But I will say that the way the professor and course staff were constantly like \"BEWARE\" about the MPs, which felt like overkill. Yes, don't start working on them the day before they're due, but starting 3 weeks early is also unnecessary. If you've got the time 3 weeks prior, by all means, go attack them, but don't feel like you've gotta start that early.\n\nIn my opinion, what's actually way more important for success in the course than coding experience is having a decent logic / proof background (majored in math as an undergrad, I felt well prepared). The reason why I say this is that the four homeworks are TYPED. Yes, you read that right. You have to reason out your answers, and you don't write any code. And the exams basically just homeworks-on-a-timer, so the bulk of the course requires having the skills to do well on these. Said another way, you could ace the MPs with a bit of C++ knowledge and yet do poorly on the homeworks and exams.\n\nThe exams are hard. With a relatively little amount of time, you have to type out correct and well reasoned answers. If you don't know how to do a question, you aren't going to have much time at all to go figure it out, which makes the experience stressful. Thankfully the exams did not use ProctorU, which was much appreciated.\n\nSupposedly the course is graded on a curve.\n\nThe course uses Piazza to share information. There was lively discussion on there that helped me out and I believe helped many others. Professor Indy and the rest of the staff were very responsive on Piazza, and I'd say quite generous with their responses. They did not give out free answers, despite people regularly asking for them, and Prof Indy did not mince words when people kept asking the same question in different ways -- \"I'm not going to tell you; go figure it out\" was usually the message he was trying to get across, which some students didn't seem to understand or accept.\n\nContext:\n* I took this as a full-time student\n* Took this concurrently with Cloud Computing Capstone and Practical Statistical Learning (was a ROUGH workload)\n* This was my final semester in the program\n* I had 5 years of professional software development experience prior to starting the program\n* Undergrad was in math (not CS)HelpfulHardStrongly Liked15 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkOne of the best courses in the online MCS12/11/2023, 10:53 AMDistributed Systems has an online version and an in-campus version that are run concurrently. The professor pays a lot of attention to the online version still and the material in the online version is on par with the in-campus version. I will echo something a previous review said though about Professor Indy being arrogant, dismissive, passive-aggressive, and sometimes outright rude in some of his replies on Piazza to student questions. He is obviously very smart, knows his stuff, and I appreciate he pays so much attention to the online class, but I wish he was a bit more patient and professional with his answers.\n\nMPs are challenging and require you to really think and understand the material in order to apply those concepts to the MP. They use C++, so if you are not familiar with low-level concepts that C/C++ use, you will struggle really bad with the MPs.\n\nExams and HWs are also challenging and require critical thinking and deep understanding of the material as well. I think exams used to be done with ProctorU, but this semester the exams were self-proctored, which I greatly appreciate.\n\nI think this course along with Practical Statistical Learning and Stat 420 is the best this program has to offer.

The lecture videos were well-produced, clearly and simply explaining the concepts. Learning this way is easier than just reading textbooks or papers.\n\nHowever, some content, specifically on certain technologies, is approaching irrelevancy. While introducing applications of distributed systems is understandable, many, like Hadoop and Storm, feel outdated. Being tested on memorizing their internals didn't seem like a good use of time.\n\nCoursera Quizzes and Exams: 8/10\n\nThe Coursera quizzes and exams were more challenging than those in other courses I've taken, requiring a deeper understanding of the material. This is positive, as it indicates actual learning.\n\nHowever, these quizzes and exams were not great preparation for the actual midterm and final exams. The midterm and final were significantly more challenging and had strict time limits.\n\nHomework Assignments: 8/10\n\nThe additional homework assignments were similarly challenging and beneficial. However, they also did not adequately prepare me for the midterm and final due to the additional difficulty and time constraints.\n\nProgramming Assignments: 6/10\n\nThe programming assignments were a mixed experience. I enjoyed applying the concepts in code and practicing C++, which I hadn't used since my undergrad years. It was satisfying to work with \"machine-level\" code after years of using dynamic languages like Python, JS, and Ruby.\n\nHowever, the setup code structure of the projects felt unprofessional. The C++ paradigms used were outdated, and the \"tests\" were poorly written, hard-to-understand bash scripts checking log entries.\n\nThe instructor's rationale for Coursera students using only C++ was its prevalence in systems code. However, on-campus students were allowed to choose from C++, Go, Python, Java, and Rust. This discrepancy suggests that the decision was likely due to a lack of interest in updating the Coursera programming assignments with more modern languages.\n\nMidterm and Final Exam: 6/10\n\nThe midterm and final exams were significantly more difficult than the Coursera exams and homework assignments. The time allotted was not sufficient to complete them. The questions were challenging, with some involving random trivia from lectures. Some questions were detailed, tedious, and time-consuming, leaving little time to complete others.\n\nCourse Staff: 3/10\n\nThe professor and course staff were very responsive on Piazza and held regular online office hours for one-on-one discussions.\n\nHowever, interactions with the professor were often lacking. He displayed arrogance and an unwillingness to acknowledge potential mistakes. A personal experience involved a misunderstanding about using Piazza for quiz clarifications. Despite adhering to the rules, the instructor hastily accused me of misconduct without proper evidence and was dismissive when I provided clarification.\n\nWhen posting questions about quizzes and homework on Piazza, the professor often provided abrupt, vague responses that left me more confused. Follow-up questions were often similarly unhelpful. In one instance, the professor insinuated that I couldn't understand basic English.\n\nSuch behavior undermines trust and creates a hostile learning environment.\n\nOverall: 6.5/10\n\nWhile CS425 provides a solid academic foundation in distributed systems, the experience is significantly marred by the instructor's unprofessional demeanor, the outdated approach to programming assignments, and the unnecessarily difficult exams.\n\nProspective students should be aware that while the content of CS425 at UIUC is strong, the experience may be negatively impacted by the instructor's behavior and the course's administrative limitations. Those considering this course, particularly through Coursera, should be prepared for these challenges in addition to the academic rigor.HelpfulHardNeutral8 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkHard, but organized and useful12/8/2023, 12:29 PMThe material in the syllabus has been discussed in other reviews, so I'll go over my personal experience with the course and the assignments. \n\nThe grades for this course are split between weekly quizzes, 2 Coursera exams, 2 timed exams, 4 written HWs, and 2 MPs. \n\nThe weekly quizzes have a pass/fail cutoff of 70% and are reasonably challenging. I often needed to refer back to the lecture, but I think its pretty easy to pass the 70% threshold each time. I think they do a good job of ensuring you're up to speed with the content discussed in each week's lectures. The coursera tests were like longer, harder versions of these quizzes, but were still reasonable. The exams were pretty brutal. The class is curved, of course, but you will not have a good time with these. \n\nThe 4 written homeworks consist of 10 questions each, but you only have answer 8 of your choosing. These homeworks were pretty challenging and definitely required some deeper thought into the lectures, but very doable. I actually enjoyed doing them and felt that they really did strengthen my understanding of the material. \n\nThe 2 MPs have been pretty controversial in past reviews, but I actually don't mind them. The lectures discuss lots of the theory behind distributed systems concepts, and the MPs ask us to implement these concepts from (almost) scratch. Other reviews are right that these MPs have pretty sparse starter code and limited documentation, but I want to believe this is by design, as it personally helped me empathize with the challenges of building these systems, but I understand why people are frustrated by this. These MPs were by far the hardest part of the course, and having to write them in C++ did not help. I think the instructor said somewhere that each MP was supposed to take 20 hours. They did. \n\nSome logistics stuff and broader thoughts: CS 425 is clearly a veteran course. Expectations are clear, assignments are released on schedule and graded like clockwork, and there were zero surprises overall. This makes it a lot easier to get into a good and reliable routine for completing assignments, which maybe compensates for its difficulty. I also do think that the lectures and syllabus of this class is more actionable and useful in my career as a software engineer compared to many other courses. \n\nOverall, I really really enjoyed taking this course and thought it was extremely well run and interesting. Professor Indy is an excellent lecturer and clearly knows his stuff. Course staff is also really responsive and easy to reach. This class definitely justifies having the highest average difficulty score of any class on this website, but the challenge is worth it. If you have the bandwidth, then I would HIGHLY recommend this class.\n\nExams not being on ProctorU is also a huge win.

They are tough \u2014> Be prepared to spend 20-30 hours for a single MP!!! We use Python but we still need a lot of time designing, coding, and debugging on VMs. Although they are challenging, the MPs significantly improved my understanding of distributed systems and coding skills. I really enjoy the time I spend with my teammate to discuss the tradeoff for different implementations, and to reach milestones continuously. We build our own distributed system from scratch - a log gripper, a failure detector, a simple file system, and a distributed work handler (map-reduce).\n\nThe midterm is much harder than the sample midterm and the time is not sufficient! I would suggest giving more time for such difficulty. I don\u2019t know the final since I gonna take the final in 5 days!!!!\n\nOne thing to improve is to include more examples or images in the slides to avoid making the course dry. Adding more practice or quizzes could be beneficial as well. I believe learning through practice is more effective than just listening to lectures. \n\nOverall, it has been a valuable part of my academic journey.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked16 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2023linkGood, but overrated12/3/2023, 9:02 AMThis course teaches a lot of content, but has a fair share of problems.\n\n1) The amount of content is HUGE.

Then the professor hears us and decided to not  using ProtorU for the final.\nAlso, Prof/TA are all very responsive on Piazza for answering the questions.\n\n\nThe lecture is very well organized and clear. The homeworks/MPs are well designed that you can understand the whole concept much better after finishing them.\nThe homeworks are difficult which may be the most time-consuming part of this course. You need to have a thoroughly understanding of contents that you can answer the questions but it helps you to get solid knowledge.\nThe MPs also helps you to practice the concept that you learned in the lecture. Some people mentioned that it is really time consuming but actually if you are good at C/C++ it is not that difficult. I used C/C++ a lot in my daily work and I think if you are good at C/C++, it should take less than 20hrs for each MPs (the second one is easier than the first one).\nThe midterm is not difficult which is a much easier version of homework. The final is hard which is the same as homeworks but you have to finish it within 3~4hrs.\n\nOverall, I strongly like this well designed course which I learned a lot.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2022linkDifficult but highly rewarding course.1/19/2023, 9:18 AMThis class was probably my favorite course so far (out of the 6 taken in the program), or at least tied for favorite. \n\nTopics:\n\nMapReduce, gossip protocol, membership lists, peer-to-peer systems, key/value stores (including a deeper dive into Cassandra), consensus protocols, mutually exclusion, leader election, file systems and shared memory, and concurrency.\n\nDifficulty: \n\nIt is a very difficult course due to the amount of information involved, and the amount of raw work you must deal with. There are four written homework assignments, two large MPs, a weekly quiz, and two exams. Video lectures take 2-5 hours to go through each week, and the quizzes should be fairly easy if you understood the lectures. The homeworks and MPs are difficult, I would say, but they're certainly not unfair or impossible.\n\nI would say it is not a difficult course to get a B or even an A in, as long as you are willing to put in the time and effort. This is in contrast to some other courses, where there seems to be a frustrating amount of \"luck\" involved, whether that's in studying the right topics, having a TA answer your question, etc. This course had plenty of office hours, including instructor ones, fair assignment descriptions, an active Piazza board, and fair exams. There are also a lot of \"free points\" in the form of quizzes that can be re-taken, and the MPs can be submitted as many times as you'd like.  There was also a curve at the end, so I wouldn't worry if your grades aren't quite as high as you'd like (follow your own syllabus of course).\n\nTeaching:\n\nThe professor for this course is very enthusiastic and absolutely loves the subject matter, and this shows in the assignments as well as the office hours and lectures. \n\nThe TAs were a bit stingy with help, but I got the feeling they were really just trying to have students come up with answers on their own. I think there is a balance here, and maybe there is some room for improvement. The TAs were otherwise excellent.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked18 hrs/wk", "Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts)Fall 2022linkGood course, moderate-heavy workload. 100% worth taking if you're CS/dev focused1/13/2023, 6:25 AMBottom line: \n- Class is absolutely worth it for anyone in / going in to the dev world  and/or wants some basic exposure to system design and how the cloud functions and is designed at a fundamental level. Mile wide, inch deep, but industry relevant and well put together content.\n- Manageable workload averaging ~9 hours, highest workload was 53 hours (because I took a two week vacation). A \u201chigh workload\u201d week outside of the vacation was about 20 hours for me. I track all my class work with Toggl, so it\u2019s fairly accurate (148 hrs over 16 weeks).\n\nBackground: \n- CS undergrad, no industry experience (started my first dev internship after class ended), no C++ experience (worked with C for an OS class in undergrad).\n\nDifficulty/workload: \n- I list class difficulty as 4/5 due to the midterm/final requiring studying a mountain of content and due to the moderate-heavy workload (also 4/5). I would not consider this a \"high/impossible workload\" or crazily difficult class, watch the lecture videos on 1.5 or 2x and it's manageable. If you've never set up an IDE/VIM/have minimal coding experience, then I could see it feeling like a 5/5. There's a sprint toward the start of the course where there's an MP, a HW, and then the following week is the midterm (around weeks 5-6)...work ahead appropriately and you'll be fine, procrastinate like I did (I took a 2 week vacation) and you'll probably have a rough go. \n- For all the homework it seems the class lectures explain the basic case / basic situation of whatever topic you\u2019re learning, and then in the homework, you\u2019re always asked an edge case. This can be a little frustrating because you feel like you\u2019re just guessing at the answer, but it does cause you to really think about and evaluate your reasoning. Frustrating learning at times, but still learning.\n\nGrade: \n- Got an A-  \n- There are a lot of essentially free points (coursera quizzes + tests + autograded MPs are multiple turn in autograded assignments that get you to about 50% uncurved). \n- Single graded/not autograded grades: HW1-4 (63%, 72%, 82%, 87%), midterm: 74%.  Final grade is not released, but I know I missed quite a few. \n- There is an undisclosed curve and based on my grades it was at least a few percent to get me to an A-. \n- All this to say, don\u2019t drop the course if you see the first HW grade and it's lower than you wanted (I thought HW1 was by far the hardest).\n\nOthers: \n- Indy is a passionate professor who cares about this class and put out some great content, but there is a vibe I got from the entire teaching staff that they are so incredibly concerned about cheating or giving an answer away that it sometimes hampers learning. There were multiple piazza posts with really good, nuanced, valid questions pointing out gaps in lecture content, or maybe a possible mistake, or maybe just a really important concept to expand on\u2026and the TAs/Staff would give vague non-answers to a lot of the great questions because someone, somewhere, might be led down the road to the eventual correct answer on the HW if the TA gives away 1/100th of the answer in their response. To clarify, overall the staff was still excellent and had to put up with SO MANY DUMB QUESTIONS, but when there were really good questions, it just sucked to see them brushed off / not answered.\n- Class organization was a bit off. I believe this was the first time teaching a \u201cnormal\u201d coursera format since Indy took sabbatical, so the organization / due dates were off and it caused dates and things to shift around a bit, which just came off as unorganized. I'm sure it\u2019s corrected for future classes.\n-These two and feeling frustrated by the HW are why I give the class a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 \n\nClass format: \n- Between 2-4 hours of video lectures each weekly module\n- Coursera \"quiz\" on each module that is unlimited attempts, pass/fail (>70% is full points)\n- Two Coursera tests that are graded normally, but are open book and allowed two attempts (highest kept)\n- Four \"homework\" assignments which are 8 questions of either short answer, pseudocode, or proof/logic writing.\n- Two MPs in C++ where you implement some missing functions of membership lists, the entire cloud network/application outside of the membership list skeleton code is given to you. You do not build from scratch.\n- Midterm and Final.

Understanding the topics often involved watching the video lectures multiple times. The video lectures on Coursera had pacing issues and I often found it difficult to fully understand the materials; I ended up watching the video lectures for on-campus students instead, as the professor did a much better presentation in these video lectures which also included many Q&A dialogs to explain things much more clearly. The homework was difficult as the questions really required you to fully understand the relevant topics inside-out. The MPs were also non-trivial and you will likely spend many hours on them.

High on both abstract thinking and practical implementation9/29/2024, 11:27 AMFoundations of Data Curation is an in-depth and highly valuable course for anyone interested in the growing field of data curation. It effectively combines theory (sometimes philosophical) with hands-on practice, to manage data lifecycles in research, industry, or archival settings. \n\nThe course lectures are just the best! The professor sometimes goes deep in explaining concepts of abstraction and indirections - which I really enjoyed. The course requires engagement with both conceptual and practical content, which may be difficult for students less comfortable with abstract thinking or theory.\n\nThe course assignments are not difficult, but need time and diligence to write up. Students who are organized and proactive with the assignments will find the workload manageable, while those who struggle with technical tools may need to spend extra time familiarizing themselves with the software and standards used in data curation. There are also several research papers to read - make sure to allocate time every week to read them. \n\nThere are several opportunities for extra credit - which can help you make up for points lost in assignments. \n\nOverall, this was a really great course.

It's not your typical \"crunching MPs and writing code\" class, but explores a lot of the history and trade-offs regarding why certain data practices became prevalent over time (e.g., how the introduction of the logical data model solved decades-old problems related to the efficient reuse and preservation of data). I think this is an extremely valuable complement to many of the 400-level classes in this program, many of which are much harder (technically) but dive into \"why\" and not \"how\".\n\nThe academic papers - both the required readings & the optional ones - were fantastic resources, and honestly one of my favorite parts of the class. You'll explore extremely important historical data design decisions as well as more recent trends, and the papers are generally very approachable. Don't just read them to pass the quiz - you'll get a lot out of this class if you spend some time reading them in full.\n\nAssignments were revamped and introduced a lot of overhead (some would say \"busy work\"). While some of it felt a little repetitive, it wasn't nearly as excessive as most made it sound. I was honestly a little embarrassed by some comments on Campuswire; several students complained an absurd amount despite the relatively light workload (this is a 500-level grad school course, and it's already one of the easier options out there, folks...). Assignments 2-3 took 6-10 hours each. Assignment 1 was similar, but split into two parts and collectively had a much longer timeframe.

Just because it doesn't teach Informatica or Alation or other tool doesn't mean it's a worthless class.  I found the writing exercises constructive, because we first have to choose what course of action to take, then we defend why we made those decisions.\n\nSo, all-in-all a good class, just set your expectations.HelpfulVery EasyLiked3 hrs/wk", "Foundations of Data CurationFall 2021linkI will not recommend this course.12/8/2021, 1:18 PMThis is the 7th course I've taken in this program. It is so far the easiest course with least workload. There are 4 assignments in total. On average, it took me ~3 hours for each assignment.\n\nMy main problem with this course is that it focuses too much on why, not on how. The course materials and assignments are centered on why data curation is important, with much less focus on how to perform data curation. As an example, all assignments will ask you to summarize benefits of some data curation activities. And part of final project is to write a memo on why data curation is important.\n\nThe format of each assignment is to first submit a peer review, then adjust submission according to peer review comments, then submit for TA/instructor grading. I got some excellent review comments from my classmates which helped me learn new things. However, I would say 80% of the comments are just \"everything looks good.\". \n\nThe techniques taught and used in this course is also outdated. 2 out of 4 assignments were using DTD validators on XML files. As far as I know, this is no longer the popular choice for industry to store or validate data. \n\nOverall, I feel a bit frustrated about this course. I agree that data curation is important.

This is the bulk of the work load. You shouldn't go into this course thinking the lecturer will guide you along the path of learning. That's not what graduate school is all about.

It was a ton of work from the programming standpoint, but the lectures described the topics well, and the assignments gave the practical implementation experience.\n\nMy only criticism is that the content documentation and assignment definitions were rather terse, making it a challenge to figure out just what was meant. \n\nThe instructor and TAs were super responsive and helpful.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Interactive Computer GraphicsFall 2017link3D, or not 3D, that is the question.11/17/2021, 5:02 PMThis course introduces the foundations of interactive 3D computer graphics using WebGL (OpenGL).  Students learn the basics of defining models, textures, animation, lights, texturing methods, user interaction, user interface, the rendering and shading pipeline, pixel shaders, basic physics for simulations, and the mathematical algorithms to implement them.  Students use the Javascript programming language to create scenes rendered in WebGL (embedded version of OpenGL) inside of the web browser, and assisted by the glMatrix math library for computation.  User interface is standard HTML while shaders are written in GLSL (GL Shading Language) which is similar to C with overloads.  The techniques learned in this course are applicable to computer games, interactive simulations, web3D, virtual reality, feature film production, and more.  However, the techniques taught are the lowest level computation of interactive 3D, not the higher level workflows as used by commercial 3D engines like Unity and Unreal.\n\nThe course consists of:\n   - lecture videos\n   - 4 machine problems\n   - 2  4th credit hour assignments (graduate students only)\n   - 3 exams (no final).  \n   There are also many worksheets and example programs to study.\n\nDepending on the semester, the course is taught by either Professor Shaffer or Professor Hart.  Professor Hart is the primary instructor having designed the course and taught it the most dating back to the days when it was taught as OpenGL using C++.  His style is fairly mellow and lax, but sometimes too lax for the student's good.  Professor Shaffer is also relaxed, but very thorough with his lectures, often going into the weeds on details which prove to be important when writing code.  This semester was taught by Professor Shaffer.\n\nThe course is primarily driven by the lectures, which are  technical / math oriented in nature (as is most computer graphics).  Computer graphics requires efficiency as it's very computationally expensive and pushes the boundaries of the hardware.  A background in systems programming or computer architecture will be useful, but not required.\n\nThe first 1/3rd of the course deals with the nuts and bolts of the OpenGL rendering/display pipeline, color theory, and human vision.  It's heavy on technical details, but required foundation just to be able to do anything in WebGL on the machine problems.  You won't be ready to write any code for at least 6 weeks.  The math involves 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 matrices through linear transformations, vectors coordinate conversions, and quaternions for rotations.  Coordinate spaces are also discussed with regards to object, world, camera, and view volume.  It's very important to understand this material as it's required to do any programming in WebGL.\n\nThe middle section of the course gets into the foundational algorithms of computer graphics with regards to drawing lines, view clipping, Z-buffering, lighting, shading, linear interpolation, and so on.\n\nDuring the last section of the course students are busy writing code to complete the machine problems, so lectures at this point steer more towards deeper theoretical topics such as parametric curves and surfaces, subdivision surfaces, and other topics of broad view.\n\nThe course has 4 machine problems, plus 2 extra machine problems for graduate students to satisfy the 4th credit hour requirement.  The first MP is very simple and mostly to get your programming environment set up and your feet wet in WebGL.  The 2nd and 3rd machine problems are quite involved as you have to address many different areas of the pipeline from loading and parsing geometry, applying textures and shading, animation, to user interface. The last machine problem is a basic physics simulator where you make balls bounce around in a box with collision detection.  In all of the machine problems, a simple user interface is included to modify parameters of the simulation to make them more interesting.  The 2 extra tasks for 4th hour credit involve adding extra features to the 2nd and 3rd machine problems.  They are not difficult, but they do take some time.\n\nOverall, the machine problems are very time consuming and involve using asynchronous techniques to make things work, such as uploading textures and geometry.  You do learn the Diamond-Square algorithm for terrain generation - the algorithm used for project Genesis in the movie 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'.\n\nExams - There are 3 mid term exams, no final exam.  The questions aren't terribly tough, but you only get 50 minutes to complete them.  You must have the answers ready to go on the tip of your tongue, and many questions that involve computation will not ask your for the final answer, but instead the value at an intermediate step of computation. You must understand the algorithms to succeed.\n\nA word of warning:  Because of the heavy amount of material that needs to be learned before you can begin to program in WebGL, many of the assignment due dates will be biased towards the latter part of the course.  Heading into the final weeks you'll find yourself working on multiple machine problems simultaneously, with the last one due just before the last exam.  The last month will be a real crunch, especially if fatigue sets in.\n\nOverall, this is a fun course, but also a lot of work and a lot of technical information.  Like most computer graphics courses, performance and efficiency are critically important to do the work.\n\nkeys to success:\n\n- Do spend a lot of time tinkering with the example code.  computer graphics is learned by doing, not reading.\n\n- Do the worksheets to practice the math algorithms (linear transformations, linear interpolation, ...).\n\n- Do get used to working with matrices instead of linear equations as is taught in math class.  Matrices are much more efficient to compute.\n\n- Do visit office hours often as man of the assignment sheets leave out critical details to complete the machine problems.\n\n- Do spend a lot of time understanding the semantics of WebGL.

Don't be blindsided, it's a ton of work, but ultimately the workload is justified by the sense of satisfaction and achievement you feel when you build really cool things and get to see them interact in the real world. \n\nA few pieces of advice would be to get into a group as soon as possible to knock out labs as it's honestly probably too much work for one person alone. Furthermore, you should start all the labs as soon as possible to make sure you can submit on time. Some of them take a lot of work and you will be miserable if you're procrastinating to the last few days. \n\nLECTURES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nThe lectures were very informative and covered a (very) wide range of topics; they were clearly created with a lot of care and have great production value, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, despite these things the lectures are undermined by the fact that they don't really connect to the rest of the course at all, save for the quizzes. With the workload of the course being centered around labs and projects, I would have expected the content from the lectures to be somewhat connected to the labs, but that was not the case. This, combined with the structure of the quizzes, made the lectures feel pretty irrelevant which was disappointing.\n\nQUIZZES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nThe quizzes are given in the classic spam-submit approach and follow the lectures very closely. If you watch the lectures while taking the quiz, you can pretty much just fill in the blanks. Of course, you could also just not watch the lectures at all and spam submit quizzes until you get full credit, which made them feel pretty tedious to complete. \n\nLABS \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nOverall, the labs for this course were awesome and definitely justify a positive rating from my perspective. Each of the labs has you build something with real-world applications and give a great sense of achievement when you complete them. That being said, not all of the labs are created equal in terms of quality or workload. In fact, the labs are so different from each other in this regard that I'm going to review them each individually. \n\nLAB 0-1 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first two labs revolve around building a toy self-driving car where the former is focused on the actual construction and the latter is geared towards creating software to facilitate the self-driving. I think it's a good thing that this lab was broken up into two because it was definitely one of the most demanding projects of the semester. Between the construction and software, this probably took around 60 hours to complete. In terms of quality, this lab was awesome, seriously. Not only was it really fun, but it also had such a great sense of scale and applicability with an added bonus of having a cool toy to show off by the end. This was easily my favorite lab of the semester. \n\nLAB 2 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThis lab had us create a frontend in Electron JS to facilitate communication (e.g. remote control) of the car. This lab was also a blast because it gave me more experience with frontend development and how to communicate from a frontend to a server. I think some of the reviews underestimate this lab, though, as it probably took ~30 hours to complete. Still, very cool and satisfying project. \n\nLAB 3 \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThis lab had us tweak and manage connection settings to learn about firewalls and security for IoT devices. This lab was a steep departure from the cool stuff we had done in the others, which left it feeling very meh. It only took ~15-20 hours of work to complete and was definitely a dud in comparison to the rest of the labs in the course. \n\nLAB 4 \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThis lab was probably the most difficult of the course. It had us use AWS to build a cloud infrastructure to simulate a fleet of vehicles communicating by sending their data into the cloud with which we had to do some data visualization for fleet metrics. I really liked the concept of this lab and the fact that we again get exposure to a related but separate sphere of IoT, but it was unfortunately undermined by severely-lacking instructions that made it extremely difficult to complete. By the end, this lab took ~80 hours to finish. \n\nLAB 5 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThis lab focused on building an IoT device outfitted with sensors to perform wildlife monitoring in a virtual African savannah. I really enjoyed this lab because of how cool the simulation was. There's a whole game built in Unity where you can walk around and pin your device on animals and track their vitals, GPS, etc. Still a significant amount of work though, ~25 hours to complete. The only real caveat here is that some aspects of the simulation were clearly broken to the point where we could only get dynamic GPS data, as the rest was static. Kind of a bummer given how cool the concept is but overall still a fantastic, engaging lab and a great way to finish off the course. \n\nFINAL PROJECT \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe final project is a completely open-ended assignment in which you build your own IoT device. This project was a ton of fun to work on and build throughout the semester and gives you a great opportunity to apply concepts from the lab to build something of your own. For my project, my team and I used an EEG sensor to record brainwaves and control the car we build remotely with our minds.

Lab 1 is hard because you have to set up the car and tinker with it to get it to work right.

In my cohort the TAs responded very slowly and often very short (and not helpful). I quickly stopped asking questions or visiting office hours as it was not worth it. This is a huge issue, because the projects are very open-ended and require a LOT of different skills, but you will be on your own (or with our team mates).\n* Professor was mostly absent, except for first few weeks (with actually very helpful comments). Too bad he checked out very soon.  \n* Lecture / course mismatch. Lectures are loosely connected to the labs at best. It feels like they might have been recycled from another Coursera course. This makes taking the quizzes which 100% refer to the lectures a distraction and an ordeal rather than helpful learning. I had to ignore most of the lectures and focus on labs (which is a shame, 'cause the lecture quality is good). \n* Workload in combination with diversity and rather confusing materials. You spend too much time re-reading lab instructions and figuring out what you are supposed to do. In addition to writing a report for each lab you'll also need to record a video demonstrating your solution and cut it down to 10 min. Allow two evenings for each (I got the Adobe Creative Cloud access through UIUC which was helpful for this). \n* Don't go solo. I tried. I started lab 1 about 3 weeks before class started and had all the materials for it ready (ordered 6 months in advance - do this!). I ended up not finishing and using up all 10 late days right there. Later I teamed up and things turned out much more managable (team, go-go!). If you work and study part-time - beware. You need (an) understanding family / friends. \n\nVERDICT:\n* Great concept with lots of potential, but confusing lab instructions, poor support by course staff and insane workload made me tick off two notches of an otherwise fantastic learning opportunity. \n* I am giving a \"very hard\" rating due to the depth and diversity of what you are required to do.

The course highly recommends forming teams, in which case you'll be splitting the time for labs between X members. I think the real time is closer to 16 hours per week, which is normal.  \n\nLabs: \nThe Lab 1 in this Fall 2022 iteration was the largest effort, but the other labs are less effort. If you can pull through Lab 1, the rest of the course is smooth sailing. You really do not need more than 1 lab partner for the whole course. For me I felt like it might be just 20-30% more work if someone did all labs on their own because the rest of the time is spent communicating / coordinating parts / reviewing a 2nd person's work. With teams of 3 or 4 you'll definitely waste more time herding cats and making sure everyone does part of the lab than actually doing the lab work. Some members may try to do very little work in the labs, so be sure to report them very early on to the TA team which takes this very seriously (including escalating to the school for academic integrity violations). Reporting issues very early on will save you many headaches down the road. You are also not required to keep the same team members for the entire course for all labs. You can remove a team member from the team for all subsequent labs if they're not pulling their weight. You can even choose to go solo. If someone is looking for a team 7+ days into the course, it's a red flag and likely not worth your time.\n\nBe sure to order your Lab 1 (the car lab) parts early as possible. Use Mouser Electronics, Digikey, or Amazon for your region to order the parts. Digikey has free shipping for orders over $50 and it takes like 3-5 days total on international orders. \n\nThis may be one of the most important and valuable courses in the program, and that I've ever taken anywhere.

The lectures were great. The quizzes were fair. And the labs were one of my favorite parts of the entire course.\n\nIf you decide to take this course, make sure you have sufficient time to work on the labs because they are VERY demanding in the best way possible. There was a pretty lenient late submission penalty, but I would avoid submitting anything late because the labs are very demanding (especially labs 1 4 and 5). \n\nThe grading was VERY generous and the course was not difficult at all. What made me put medium for difficulty is the workload required by the course. All of the lectures and quizzes can be completed in a couple of weekends. Since the labs are the only thing in this course that require so much time, it would do you well to start as early as you can, especially if you are doing everything solo like I did.\n\n\nOverall, this course was so much fun and I learned so much. I am not sure if the things I learned are applicable in the field I am in, but I would still highly recommend this course. It opened my eyes when it comes to IoT devices and how accessible and easy it is to create wonderful solutions.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2022linkGood Lectures, Poor Labs5/18/2022, 11:45 AMI really enjoy courses that do not make you take exams, however this course was very frustrating to take. I don't know if I just had a bad experience for the semester, but the the labs were just very unclear on what the requirements were and how to do what we were supposed to do. On top of that, the TAs were not helpful enough to make it clear on what to do. A lot of the time I spent going to office hours was asking what they wanted us to submit.\n\nFor example, there was one lab where we had to use AWS. AWS was not covered in any of the lectures, and we had to figure out what to do not from the lab documentation itself, but from AWS tutorials. This was very frustrating and contributed to the workload.  \n\nThe lectures were very well put together however, if you like to learn that way you will learn a lot from them. However, I am not the type to sit and enjoy lectures.\n\nOverall the class wasn't \"difficult\" per se, but it was frustrating because of the obscurity of how to complete the work. That makes it difficult to work with.HelpfulMediumNeutral25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2022linkVery good lectures, labs are intense5/18/2022, 2:53 AMThe best part of this course are the lectures. Professor Cesar explains really well, with easy to follow along lectures, great visuals and examples. Loads of stuff can be found online too, but the lectures provided a great summary of everything you need to know.\n\nThe weekly quizzes are very fair, with unlimited attempts (although after 3 quizzes you need to wait for 8 hours). The answers can all be derived from the lectures, and also provide a good check of your understanding.\n\nThe labs were a good hands on experience, but took loads of time, and quite some frustration too. The content of the labs differ from the lectures, so you learn a broad range of topics in this course. I did all labs individually, in hindsight finding a good motivated group in the beginning would have definitely been a wiser decision. Biggest advice is to start each lab from day 1 of it being released. They do take an insane amount of time (especially lab 1 and lab 4). There were many hiccups, and many changes to the labs throughout the process, so I bet the students starting the labs early had a tougher time dealing with hiccups, however, if you procrastinate, you will not finish the labs on time, or will end up finishing multiple labs simultaneously in the final weeks. My worst experience was lab 4. I was very lost and the lab instructions were messy too. I ended up never finishing lab 4, and not handing it partly in either. But grading of all other labs was very fair (and I did all extra credit), so my grade wasn't sufferly punished for missing one lab. It is a shame though, because I do believe lab 4 would have been a great learning experience. I do partly blame myself for not trying hard enough either; I lost motivation and confidence due to the poor instructions.\n\nAnother advice: keep an eye on Piazza at all times. Changes to labs are mentioned there, scattered over several posts, so might not always be obvious/clear.\n\nFinal project is very open ended, but you do need to submit a fairly detailed proposal, so that can help you in verifying whether your project will be suitable for the course. \n\nTAs try their best to help. Office hours were great to join, although the solution to bugs in the assignments were not always resolved. Towards the end, not all Piazza posts were responded to, but overall I think the TAs really tried their best.\n\nOverall: great professor, active TAs, not a lot of structure in the labs. Invest loads of time into the course + be open for the unstructured labs, and you will have a good experience. I have definitely struggled along the way and doubted my choice for taking the course, but after finishing it, and realizing the amounts of topics I have learned, I am happy I pushed through.HelpfulHardLiked30 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2022linkGreat lectures, interesting topic, SO. MUCH. WORK.5/17/2022, 5:29 PMMy favorite part of this course was the lectures. They were clear, easy to follow, and covered such a wide range of topics in such detail that, by the time you get through everything, you feel like you know everything about everything. \n\nThe labs were also helpful in learning and solidifying concepts, but it was an incredible amount of work. I work full-time and have two small children, so this class really pushed me to my physical limits. I also made the mistake of not going into it with a group, so I had to shoulder the entire workload alone. By the time I realized my mistake, I started reaching out for a partner but everyone was already partnered up and I didn't hear back from everyone. Advice, I guess, is, try to get a lab partner. Even if you like working alone, it will be worth it. \n\nThe most frustrating things about the course were (1) My M1 Mac. I think at least 3/5 of the labs simply did not work on an M1 Mac and it took about 8 hours of work to realize this. Which, when I have so little time in a day to spare, was actually a huge cost. (2) Labs and requirements were altered on the fly. I spent a long time getting one piece of my lab to work only to find out that it was descoped and made extra credit. While I was glad for the extra credit, I love sleep more. \n\nIn my opinion, if you can make it past lab 1, you can make it through this class. (having some cloud background helps a lot for lab 4)\n\nAm I glad I took this course?? .... yes...in retrospect. But the wounds are still a bit fresh. Ask me in a month and I may say it was the best course I've ever taken.HelpfulHardNeutral20 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2022linkGreat class- learn lots of tech but requires focus5/16/2022, 3:15 AMThis is a great class and I highly recommend it. It required constant, hard work, but it is was all enjoyable and I learned a lot of useful techniques. I think the majority of students in the program will enjoy the class. A small section of people that like a lot of structure might be frustrated.\n\n\nPrevious comments about the high workload and great professor are all accurate. Readers of these reviews should take all lab time estimates with a grain of salt - labs 2 and 3 were more time-consuming than I expected based on readings here.\n\nI think this is due one of the class's best parts: how much hands-on experience the labs give you with a wide variety of technology. As such, you may be able to complete one of the labs much easier because you have prior experience with some technology.\n\nThe lab's in this class are ambitious in their design and learning objectives. As would be expected, sometimes they don't behave exactly as described or intended. The grading policy was fair based on this. Some students were indignant about things not working \"exactly as described\" in the guides, but since it never impacted my grading I was OK with it. If having a few \"bugs\" in the labs is what it takes in order to have labs that are this engaging and useful, I'm on board with it!\n\nTo wrap-up with a note to prospective students: this class leaves a lot to your independent study. There is a lot of risk to go down \"rabbit holes\" in completing a lab. There is a lot to be learned here, and that's an important part, but be careful. Rather than complete each lab step to perfection in order, I recommend making a complete first pass through each lab, maybe not as well as you'd like, and making corrections to individual steps on a future pass.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2022linkExceptional course with some hiccups5/15/2022, 2:27 PMI really enjoyed this course. It was my first in the online MCS program. The level of rigor and engagement was what I was hoping for.\n\nThere are ~20 hours of lectures over the course of the semester and a quiz almost every week. Quizzes aren't too bad, usually 10 multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank questions, but some had as many as 20. The questions relate directly to the lecture material, though I think some of the quizzes had questions covering previous lectures. The lectures were great.\n\nThere were 5 labs and a final project. These are the major focus of the course. Also an extra credit \"Lab\" 6 but all we did was play a game being developed for research and once finished sent the files of the completed game to prove we played it. It may have been for this semester only. There is a huge disparity in the amount of work you do for each lab. Personally, the labs were my favorite part of the class.\n\nI never joined a team so I completed all of the labs and the final project on my own. I managed okay but it was a LOT of work, especially while working full time.\n\nLab 1 took me over 100 hours. It was an implementation of a self-driving car controlled with a Raspberry Pi. The lab instructions provide links to most of the equipment needed, but I looked other places for some of it to find better availability. You set up the Raspberry Pi, build the car, get familiar with the libraries and some code that implements the driving. Then try to implement self-driving yourself. Then you set it up to drive a route while navigating around obstacles. After that you try to process images from a pi camera leveraging TensorFlow libraries to obey traffic laws like stopping at a stop sign or a red light.\n\nLab 2 took maybe 10-15 hours. You use Bluetooth and WiFi to wirelessly share information about the car, and eventually remote control it with a web frontend.\n\nLab 3 took ~15 hours. You learn to set up a firewall, inspect packets with Wireshark, analyze wireless networks near you and answer some questions about them, and set up a virtual network in GNS3.\n\nLab 4 took over 100 hours, probably a little more than Lab 1. You learn how to use AWS IoT, AWS Greengrass, Sagemaker, about MQTT protocol etc... to communicate and analyze data about a virtual network of cars. There was a huge learning curve with this one.\n\nLab 5 took maybe 20-25 hours. You simulate a wildlife monitoring device and deploy it in a virtual environment populated with animals. You navigate around the environment and attach your devices to animals, run it for a while, then analyze and create visualizations of the data that's been collected.\n\nThe final project was extremely open ended, but there were mountains of examples of what you could do in the documentation. I for one loved the open ended aspect as I was able to do something I was very interested in. You turn in a proposal for it a little over halfway through the semester and they will give feedback. I had no issues there. The final project is supposed to take 15-25 hours per person. The project I chose took maybe 65. A lot harder than I expected but it was worth it.\n\nYou make a video/report for every lab and the final project. Making these can sometimes take a very long time so it is important to account for that if you\u2019re going to be running up against a deadline.\n\nPros:\n\nVery rigorous course, lots to learn and appreciate, definitely worthy of consideration for anyone in the program. The professor and the TAs I thought were very helpful for most the semester. The class page on the Piazza forum was a good place to work out any problems. Responses were generally timely and helpful, though not always. There is a ton of extra credit available if you want a little boost. Part of labs 2 and 4 were extra credit, and lab 6 was all extra credit. There were pre and post lab quizzes for lab 5 that were extra credit. The lab 4 documentation was a little messed up (this is a con, of course) and the instructors offered extra credit to help improve it.\n\nCons:\n\nEach of the labs had some issues, but most were addressed adequately and promptly. Labs 4 and 5 had the most. I mostly was okay with the Lab 4 documentation, but there were some instructions that weren't super clear to me. I started on the labs very early and as a result frequently ran into the issues before most people. I'd post a question to the class page on Piazza or check to see if one had already been posted. All the issues were worked out with plenty of time to finish. The Lab 5 instructions were fine, but the simulation software had bugs and this lead to some frustrations. I think this led to a lot of students feeling stressed and dissatisfied with the organization of the course, especially because many were trying to get the final projects finished. But again, for me it wasn't much of an issue. I just turned to Piazza and waited for an answer. Eventually one of the lab requirements was dropped. This was the first semester Lab 5 was not extra credit. I expect it to be better the next time this class is offered. Of the over 300 hours I spent on this course, I wasted maybe 5 with lab issues needing clarification/correction.\n\nThe instructor/TAs disappeared a bit in the last couple weeks. That was frustrating for a lot of students.\n\nGrading was not timely. This class is over and grades have still not been posted for labs 4 and 5. Though, strangely, my final project was graded within hours of being submitted.\n\nBetween the pi car equipment and the final project hardware, I spent over 300 dollars on the class. May have even been over 400.\n\nAdvice: \n\nIf you don't want to do a lot of work, don't take this course. If you want to learn and are willing to work for it and have time to dedicate the hours, do take this course.\n\nGet started on the labs as early as possible, especially Lab 1. You need to buy a lot of equipment for it and there were availability issues, lots of stuff out of stock and shipping weeks out. Ordering this equipment is the first thing I would do. The later labs don't need more equipment, except you may need a Bluetooth dongle for Lab 2. Also, a dedicated computer monitor you can use for your raspberry pi UI would make labs 1-4 easier, along with a wireless mouse and keyboard.\n\nTo reiterate, do not procrastinate. If you get behind, you will be miserable. Get started early. That way if you have questions, you\u2019ll have ample time to get them answered.\n\nFor Lab 1, if things don\u2019t work perfectly, especially as the lab progresses, don\u2019t panic. Try to get it as good as possible, then describe in your report the challenges and what you tried.\n\nRely on AWS documentation and tutorials for Lab 4 (the lab instructions tell you to do this and include links). They will help you understand what is going on and what the lab instructions are talking about if you have no experience with the subject matter. You don\u2019t need to do all the tutorials but it\u2019s good to start at the beginning of the instructions for AWS IoT and go until you can set up Greengrass and add and run lambda functions. It\u2019s important to understand MQTT protocol. Later you may need tutorials for Sagemaker and Jupyter notebooks if you have no experience with them. I felt extremely overwhelmed and confused when I first read through the lab instructions, but with the help of AWS documentation I slowly but surely finished the lab, and with flying colors, and was able to get an A+ in the class.\n\nAgain, I loved this course and would do it over again.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2022linkNot what I expected5/15/2022, 4:08 AMI'm an online student. Before taking the course, I'd read many positive reviews so I was looking forward to it and had high expectations of this course. However, I have to say it was really not what I expected.\n\n1) There are in total 6 labs (Lab 6 is optional and you'll receive extra credits if you choose to take it) and a final project. The first three labs were well-organized and I did learn many new techniques and skills by doing the three labs. Starting Lab 4, unfortunately, the instructions were poorly documented and they were so bad that the TAs even asked students to help edit and improve those documents. \n\n2) Also starting Lab 4, the TAs became less and less responsive, and often times we would receive a response *AFTER* the submission deadline. If you are curious about why I didn't mention the professor, well, he was on Piazza answering questions *ONLY* in the first few weeks, and he was gone for most of the semester...\n\n3) Today is the last day of the final project's submission deadline, and we haven't yet received grades for lab 4 and lab 5. \n\nOverall, I learned a lot by doing the labs but this was not the quality I expected from this course. And by quality, I meant the support from the TAs and the professor, and the completeness of all the instructions for the labs. I feel super frustrated that the professor seems not caring about his online students since I wouldn't know how he is in an on-campus course. Despite many frustrations from the TAs and the professor, fortunately, I've had excellent teammates so I was able to finish all labs and the final project on time. \n\nAt the end of the day, I feel this course is still in development, and Lab 4 & 5 were so poorly designed that they shouldn't release them. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this course if you are an online student.HelpfulHardStrongly Disliked30 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsFall 2021linkThis course is amazing!5/13/2022, 1:48 PMProbably one of my favourite courses yet! I cannot say enough good things about this course, even with some technical difficulties along the way.\n\nThe professor gives you a strong theoretical understanding of IOT during lectures, while the labs teach you a very different, but amazing set of practical skills. You get to build a robot kit car, program it for obstacle avoidance, basic mapping, computer vision and basic automated driving. Beyond this, you also implement firewalls, learn about networking, big data for a vehicle emissions machine learning project, and implement your own IOT device by the end of the semester.\n\nThis course is a lot of work in the first and last month and a half. You may find for a week or two in the middle of the semester, you feel like there isnt much to be done. Make sure you spend that time catching up or working ahead in classes as the end of the semester can be just as busy as the first month and a half was.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsFall 2021linkCourse Videos are great, labs are fun and were modified in 2021.12/25/2021, 6:37 PMI took this class since CS425 was not offered this Fall.\n\nBe aware that the majority (if not all) of the labs in this course were likely remade in Spring 2021 and some labs still have not worked out yet in Fall 2021, resulting in some labs having issues.\n\nThe lecture videos are great! Quizzes have unlimited retries given as well. The only thing I wish was having labs more closely related to the videos, but maybe I'm asking too much :)\n\nLab1 is about self driving car and is well-made. Spent probably 50 hours on this lab and learned a lot. Best labs of all and it will give you confidence to get into self driving car industry.\n\nLab2 is about bluetooth/Wifi control and is also well made! You will learn a bit about network programming in python, along with express.js.\n\nLab3 is about networking/firewall with no programming needed. I wished some programming assignment is given for lab3. For lab3 part 2 it was offered as EC, and I did not do it as it doesn't look really interesting and requires setting up VMs.\n\nLab4 Part 1 is about Machine Learning, which is really good! We had several issues with Part2 AWS IoT part. The instructions given were for AWS IoT did not work out and wasted us a lot of time. But Part2 became EC due to that reason.\n\nLab5 was supposed to be great, but there were issues with the playground which prevented us from completing it, and became an EC. The website was also down for like a week which caused us to have some scheduling issues to complete the lab.\n\nFinal project was too open ended. I wished there were some guidelines on it. But the grading was very lenient for it.\n\nLabs 1-4 also require Peer Review which kind of sucks as it is kind of subjective, and we had to grade others as well (like 3 groups). Kind of unnecessary extra work. But I guess it's good to watch out for.\n\nI would suggest to wait for another iterations or two until the lab issues were confirmed to be fully sorted out before taking this course. Also actively follow-up with the TA when there are issues with gradings in Coursera (do not wait till the last minute thinking they will fix it, as we had some issues with final grades which we had to email back and forth during christmas). \n\nThis course probably has the highest potential to be the greatest course of MCS if most of the lab issues are resolved.\n\n\nAnd don't try to pair this with another class. In addition be prepared to get stuck on some labs due to technical issues, until they polished them out.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsFall 2021linkGenuinely sad the course is over11/23/2021, 12:52 PMThis class is incredibly well taught, and had a great balance between being wide enough to give context while still going in-depth into the important IoT concepts.  Professor Caesar's excitement about the material is evident, and both of our TAs were very active on Piazza and super helpful.  \n\nThe course has 5 labs, weekly quizzes, and a final project.  Each lab will be a challenge, and the first and fourth labs will be very time consuming.  The course staff highly recommends working in groups, but it is possible to work alone (I worked with an amazing group which helped me get more out of the course).  The labs seem to be fluctuating, and several parts were turned into extra credit/given extensions.  You do need to purchase some equipment, could be about $200 or so.  Looking at the labs, each lab was fantastic and taught different skills.  We did peer reviews for other groups which was very fun, and the other groups did a great job.  Labs required a video and a report.\n\nThe weekly quizzes are fair, and highlight the important parts of the lectures.  Some weeks the videos pile up, but again all of the info was very well presented.  The quizzes have pretty loose deadlines, but you can get behind pretty quickly.  They are in Coursera with unlimited attempts.  \n\nThe final project is very open ended, but you have to submit a proposal mid-semester to ensure you don't go off into left field.  We are having a bunch of fun with adding in extra capabilities, since our proposal gave us flexibility to add in stretch goals.\n\nBottom line: I learned so much from this course.  While I lost some sleep trying to finish a few labs, I highly recommend this course.  This was my first course in the program so I cannot compare it to other courses, but I can say that this is doable course for coming into the program.  You may pull your hair out over the labs, but seeing the pieces all come together and work is amazing.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked25 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsSpring 2021linkSo incredibly cool.  Hard work, but I loved it.10/11/2021, 8:58 AMBefore dissecting the class, I should point out that prior to this class, I had virtually no hardware or engineering experience, so this was all new to me, but I found it fascinating. If you already have a background in Electrical Engineering, some of the lectures may be more of a review for you. Professor Caesar has a passion for the subject, and really wants to light that same fire in his students, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He's extremely flexible in allowing individual study and taking risks and experimenting to see what happens, even if you're not successful.\n\nLecture videos are really interesting. The professor does a fantastic job of covering ground quickly, all the way from how the internet works clear through to specific considerations for deploying IoT devices in the field. My only complaint is that while these lectures were well-done and engaging, they didn't really relate to the four \"lab\" assignments, which seemed in some cases, to almost have been from a different class.\n\nAssignments - difficulty level varies WILDLY between the four labs. The first lab should probably be two separate assignments - 1) build the IoT Raspberry Pi car, and 2) deal with computer vision, auto-driving, map-building, etc. But it's one assignment, so it's huge. Labs 2 and 3 were very short and easy (Lab 3 we only had the first half ready in time for us to do it -- the second half was offered as extra credit later in the semester). Lab 4 (dealing with AWS) was again huge -- many, many hours of trying to decipher poor instructions to divine what was even being asked. I believe the four labs were written and graded mostly by the TAs, and it really shows. Many hair-pulling-out moments in those assignments. Lab 5 also wasn't quite ready in time, so it was released late, also as extra credit, but it may have been the best lab of the whole course -- you built an IoT circuit in a virtual lab, then deployed it in a virtual 3D game world (attaching it as a tag on zebras!) and watched how it behaved. SUPER cool.\n\nQuizzes are a little tricky sometimes, but since you get unlimited tries, it's not too hard to get 100%. And NO EXAMS is great, in that you don't have to put up with Proctor U -- the course is entirely project-based (well, also the quizzes, I guess). The final project is \"build your own physical IoT device from scratch,\" so it can be as easy or hard as you make it, but my advice is to try and solve a real-world problem, something that you would actually use yourself. I did not anticipate I'd learn as much or get as much done when I began the class, but really surprised myself with how much I enjoyed tinkering.\n\nDifficulty is on the difficult side. The quizzes are easy, and the final project depends on how much you want to get out of it. The \"lab\" assignments are what makes the course difficult, and of the four, only two are particularly difficult, but they're *quite* difficult.\n\nWorkload is moderate-to-heavy. You need to spend 2-3 hours on video and quizzes, and while the middle two labs were quick and easy (< 6 hours each), the first and fourth labs took far, far longer than that. We're talking 20 - 50+ (!) hours each. And the final project at the end certainly may take some significant time. I took this class in conjunction with another (PSL) and that, in hindsight, was really dumb. Do not do that unless you know you have a lot of time to spare.\n\nIndividual grades were a little lackluster -- surprise requirements not explicitly laid out in the grading rubric, coupled with waiting weeks and weeks for the grades to get published. But, even for people who were not happy with their grades on individual assignments, I think they all were happy with their final grade -- I'm not sure if it was heavily curved or just \"everyone gets an A if they tried hard\", but it was super-generous. I would have liked feedback on my final project (I'm still waiting...), but other than that, the course itself was very educational, I really enjoyed it, and can strongly recommend it, with these few reservations. If you take the class, don't get hung up on the individual grades -- know that the professor is really generous at the end of the semester if you try your best -- and just enjoy digging in.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked30 hrs/wk", "Internet of ThingsFall 2020linkUnadulterated Fun9/3/2021, 1:27 PMThis course was so fun.

I found it weird though that the first 2-3 MP's just wanted you to submit a txt file with the solution and didn't ask for the code at all but the later MP's required a code submission via Gradescope.\n\nCourse Staff was super available and always answered questions on Campuswire fairly quickly.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked6 hrs/wk", "Introduction to Data MiningSpring 2024linkHard but so worth it5/6/2024, 7:26 AMThis is my most favorite course at MCS so far. You get to implement 7 data mining algorithms, including Agglomative Clustering, Frequent Word Mining, Decision Tree etc., from scratch. You are allowed to use only standard functions and nothing else: numpy, scikit-learn, pandas cannot be used. This really help me solidify my programming skills and understanding of each algorithm. I really liked this get-hands-dirty-first approach. Some programming assignments are undeniably tough but definitely worth tackling.\n\nThe lecture quality is high, and TAs are very engaged. TAs responded to my questions in a timely manner on Campuswire.\n\nThe course consists of 3 main concepts: Pattern Discovery, Clustering, and Classification. The first two are the same contents as the free MOOC version, but the Classification module is exclusive to the MCS program.\n\nI think the exams are very fair. There are a lot of concepts to learn, but you can make and bring a cheat sheet for each exam. Summarizing for a cheat sheet itself was a very good learning activity.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in data science or just want to brush up Python (or any other programming language) skills. I expect A or A- for the final grade.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Introduction to Data MiningSpring 2024linkToo dense for its own good3/18/2024, 9:07 PMThis course is very dense.

Expect to grind for the exams, as they have some gotchas. \n\nThe Projects/Quizzes are easy to 100%, which make it feasible to atleast get a B even if you don't do well on the exams.\n\nI would not recommend taking this class if you did not have any sort of computer science background, because even then you will feel more anxious with the swath of content in each module.\n\nIf you're trying to get an A, this class is tedious because the lectures are NOT great, and you have to cram.HelpfulMediumStrongly Disliked30 hrs/wk", "Introduction to Data MiningSpring 2023linkWell-organized primer to data mining8/6/2023, 12:29 AMInstructor: Han, Jiawei\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is only relevant for the Spring 2023 iteration and may not hold for future iterations.\n\nTime Breakdown:\nTotal: 98.75 hr, Mean: 6.17 hr, Min: 1.6 hr, Max: 11.98 hr, SD: 2.77 hr\n\nBackground:\n- 4th course in the MCS program\n- Only course taken this term\n- Full time Software engineer (> 5 YoE)\n- Employer covering tuition\n\nGrade Breakdown:\n- 20.80% Quiz (0.9% x 23)\n- 34.65% Homework (4.95% x 7)\n- 44.55% Exam (14.85% x 3)\n\nAdditionally, some extra credit (up to 2% maximum) opportunities were given:\n- Answer Campuswire questions (first to answer and give a quality answer)\n- Point out errors/typos in the lecture materials (first to find)\n\nMaterial:\nThis course covers various data mining topics and is broken down into three distinct modules:\n- Pattern Discovery\n- Cluster Analysis\n- Classification\n\nEach part is covered in four weeks, and there is an exam on the fifth week.\n\nThe most unique parts of the course would be pattern discovery and cluster analysis. For classification, there is quite some overlap in material with that in other courses like AML and PSL. In that regard, it is somewhat nice to have further reinforcement of topics.\n\nLectures:\nThere is typically 1-2 hours of lecture each week. All lectures are given by Han. He mostly reads from the slides and often covers concepts at a high level. To understand the low level details to do the homeworks, go to office hours, read the textbook, or review past office hour recordings on the specific topics. The course staff have been good about providing recordings of past material that go into concepts more deeply compared to in lecture.\n\nThere is a companion textbook (co-written by Han) that I read before watching lectures. The course provided PDFs so not necessary to purchase the book. It was quite helpful but there were some minor inconveniences:\n- Sometimes the recommended chapter/sections didn't align up with the lectures, so you have to search around the book to find the right chapter/section\n- Sometimes the lectures cover some concepts not in the book, so you had to watch them anyway.\n\nDo note that Han's research is in the pattern discovery space, so the material is biased toward research from his group. I don't think it is a bad thing, and if you find this topic interesting, I guess you could visit Han's office hours. Han provides links to many research papers for further reading, but I did not make the time to read them.\n\nSupport:\nCampuswire is used, but Han was not involved. The TAs handled all the questions, but somewhat not responsive.\n\nBoth the TAs and Han hold OH. No comment on office hours as I did not attend any. But I did refer to some past OH recordings on specific topics to understand them better, as lectures can leave out the tiny details.\n\nQuizzes:\nThey are on Coursera. Each week there are typically two quizzes.\n\nQuizzes have unlimited attempts. You will see new questions on each attempt, so I recommend to attempt the quizzes multiple times. The quizzes are due at the end of their respective module, i.e. end of the fifth week.\n\nHomework:\nTypically two homeworks per module and due at the end of the module.\n\nThe language you use depends on how the homework is submitted:\n- Coursera: you submit an output file, so you can use any language\n- Gradescope: you submit a completed Python template provided by the staff\n\nIn all assignments, you do them solo and you implement the algorithm/concept from scratch. You have unlimited submissions as well.\n\nAll assignments are autograded. For Gradescope assignments, the staff provide you with some basic test cases but evaluate you on hidden test cases. They don't run the hidden test cases until after the deadline, so you should write your own test cases to cover edge cases.\n\nThe homeworks were not too trivial - you have to understand the algorithm details to implement correctly. Also, reading Campuswire posts was helpful for me whenever I got stuck.\n\nExams:\nThe exam weeks are every fifth week and have no lecture so it was nice for studying and finishing up on homework.\n\nThe nice part is that each exam material is pretty much independent of each other. The not so nice part is that you have to use (and pay) ProctorU three times.\n\nProctorU aside, I thought the exams were fair:\n- 2 hour time limit is plenty (at least for me)\n- Question format consistent with quizzes\n- Practice exam consistent with the real exam\n- Almost everything in the exam is technically found in the lecture slides\n\nYou are allowed one double-sided cheatsheet (handwritten or typed). Also a 4-function calculator (example: TI-30XS) -- I highly recommend having one as there will be computation questions with not so nice numbers.\n\nConclusion:\nI think this course was interesting for its coverage of pattern mining which is not covered as much in ML. In terms of organization, it is fairly well structured, as it has been taught for several iterations.\n\nLike many other courses in the MCS program, this one is a survey course and is \"mile wide, inch deep\" in its coverage. So, I think that there were too few assignments for the amount of material the course covered and it would be nice to have more.HelpfulMediumLiked7 hrs/wk", "Introduction to Data MiningSpring 2023linkIntro to ML Theory & Writing Algorithms from Scratch7/21/2023, 1:19 PMThis course teaches the math and algorithms behind introductory machine learning models and concepts.

This approach forces you to truly grasp the underlying concepts and develop proficiency in Python programming (Java and C++ were also options).\n\nThe course structure is well-designed, and the lectures are informative but leave much to be desired. The recorded office hours with TAs were immensely valuable. I appreciated that the projects directly built on the lecture material and that the TAs were actively engaged on Campuswire.\n\nOverall, I found this course to be rewarding.

I enjoyed the course for the most part but I wish that the lectures were a bit more in-depth. As an introductory course, the focus understandably is on covering the topics broadly, but it still felt a little light with most weeks only having two hours or less of required lecture videos. I referred to the textbook on occasion as well as the optional TA videos to help solidify some of the concepts.\n\nThere were 7 programming assignments with the last 4 being Gradescope submissions that had half visible and half hidden test cases. I felt the assignments were fairly straightforward with the majority of the assignments taking 4-6 hours to program. I chose to do all of the assignments in Python but you get a choice of C++, Java, or Python.\n\nGrading also felt pretty straightforward and fair. You should be able to get all the points on the quizzes since they have unlimited attempts. Assuming you do well on the 7 MPs, you can have some cushion for the exams which are similar to the quizzes in difficulty.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the course and as someone with no exposure to machine learning, it gave me a good introduction.

Quizzes have unlimited attempts and differ per attempt, so even when scoring full points, retake the quiz to get some additional practice questions.\n\nMPs are doable. 4 out of 7 have to be submitted via Hackerrank and have to be implemented from scratch. I wasn't a huge fan of doing them from scratch, but it does really help with understanding the content well. I probably spend the most time of the course on the MPs, but I don't have a solid programming background.\n\nThe exams are fair, especially if you've watched the lectures and attempted all quizzes multiple times. A one double-sided cheat sheet is allowed during the exam. I wrote all content I struggled with, and several quiz questions on my cheat sheet (I wrote very tiny to fit a lot on the paper).\n\nI really learned a lot, despite not investing as much time as I hoped to/should have.

It was much more satisfying this way, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning how various structures and algorithms fundamental to ML work and are implemented. Also, I personally had no problems with Hackerrank (used to grade 4 out of the 7 assignments).\n- The topics: They lay a foundational groundwork for ML and data science, covering topics from pattern discovery to CNNs, giving me a good breadth in these topics.\n- Support: Office hours were useful (from past recordings), and TAs (and fellow students) were active and helpful on Campuswire. \n\nWhat I didn't enjoy:\n- Lectures were very long, and I felt I got more value by just referring to the slides and reading the textbook\n- There were so many concepts to remember for each midterm that a cheat sheet was allowed for all of them. Hence, I spent a lot of time cramming my cheatsheet rather than deep-diving into topics of interest, and it was overwhelming at times.\n\nHow I maximized my Learning: I made notes using the slides, and then read the textbook chapters relevant to the section, filling in my notes with more details missing from the slides.\n\nBottom Line: Despite an overload of theoretical concepts that made exams somewhat challenging, I'd strongly recommend this course purely based on the nature of the assignments; despite being my first course, I think it will be a solid foundation for those looking to explore ML-heavy courses in the program.HelpfulHardLiked20 hrs/wk", "Introduction to Data MiningSpring 2022linkGreat class5/13/2022, 12:38 PMYou learn the basics related to Machine Learning.

(assgnmnt+quiz=55%, exam=45% for 3 exams). The professor and the TAs take time to answer questions on office hours. Campuswire also helps with technical questions.  The students should be asked to do this class (and Stat420) before being asked to do Machine Learning, Deep learning, NLP, etc. The students will benefit a lot by doing this class before ML, DL, etc (unless you come with prior experience in those areas) because it lays the foundation.

Keep track of your progress on the available schedule. That way you won't miss anything.\n\nTA's were quite helpful early in the semester but became less active on the forum as time went on, but there were office hours very often. I never attended them.\n\nFor the final project, the proposal needs to be approved by instructor/TA's.  The proposal deadline was pushed back and took a bit to get approved, so I had mostly finished my portion of the project by the time our proposal even got approved. Not ideal but it worked out. I would recommend starting on the group project as early as you are comfortable with, looking for datasets that fit the requirements. Alternatively, you can team up with someone who already has a dataset in mind. If you don't know anyone in the class, you can find a teammate by making a post on the forum, or responding to someone else's post looking for a teammate. Otherwise, you will be put with a random person, which took some time and was a frustrating process for many people who went that route.\n\nExams were moderately difficult, a lot like the quizzes but slightly different questions. Time was the biggest issue, especially on Exam 2, but that was mostly due to copy/paste being inadvertently disabled for the exam (for all students, not just me). Due to the issues the grades for the exams were curved slightly for student benefit.\n\nWe were instructed to submit HW's and the individual project on Gradescope and Coursera. Coursera submissions are used as a backup. Grades were released on Gradescope first, and not until the end of the semester on Coursera. Regrade requests can be made on Gradescope and were addressed promptly. It seems to be nearly impossible to get a perfect score on the HW's or individual project. If you get docked for a few little things here and there, don't fret. It happens to everyone in the class. The individual project is similar to the HW's, but more open ended and organized differently.\n\nGrading was slow, granted the assignments are difficult to grade. \n\nDo your best to submit everything on time and on both Gradescope and Coursera, otherwise you may be in for a headache. I had an issue with Gradescope one week as I was on vacation during the brief period submission was open and had emailed myself the wrong HW, so couldn't submit. I had submitted to Coursera so told the TA's to grade the Coursera submission. I didn't know the status of it until the day final grades were due. It ended up being fine and I got an A+ in the class.\n\nI'm not going to provide an overview of the material, as there is a lot of it, but if you want to look over the material prior to taking the class, the book can be found at https://book.stat420.org.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked12 hrs/wk", "Methods of Applied StatisticsSummer 2022linkBest in structure and content in the MCS program8/16/2022, 8:36 AMThis should be a mandatory course for DS track, it is structured beautifully and builds up week over week.

I'll provide highlights with respect to Summer 2022 offering, general advice and observations.\n\nYes, this summer had logistical hiccups. Namely: \n\n1. The professor was hard to reach until you figured out that you need to email him directly with the subject line starting with \"[STAT 420]\". He likely uses a filter rule for his email.\n\n2. Grading and feedback on assignments is slow. It is currently Friday when final grades are due to the University, which I have received. However, our project group does not have feedback on our final project yet.  One workaround is to go to OH with your assignment after the HW deadline has passed, so the TA can compare your answers to their solution (again assuming you don't yet have access).\n\n3. Some assignments will be posted from the prior year, just start on them, the professor will either have made no change or will allow you to submit that assignment instead of the current term's version.\n\n4. There is an error in the testing rules for Exam 2, we are supposed to be allowed to use copy-paste. This may get fixed, it may not.  Just plan ahead.\n\nGeneral Advice:\n\n1. Take the course, the content and approach is fantastic for learning.  It needs repetition.\n\n2. Take the course first / early in the MCS. All of DS is based on this material.  I'm taking PSL after this course, which seems like a great way to prepare for that course, which is also in R and has a small amount of material overlap in the first couple weeks.\n\n3. You can lose a lot of small points on the HWs, the grading can be very nit-picky, it just depends on the TA.  The TAs are provided the solution and then decide the grading rubric themselves. I did not hear of anyone getting points back and there's a potential to lose additional points. Just lean towards too much information and discussion when writing your HW.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. As mentioned above, taking this course earlier in the MCS could help a lot. If your career path is along DS, then this material will also be relevant as interview preparation, so dig into the math and read the optional chapters.  Generally speaking, read the book even if you watched all the videos and think you understand.  There is sometimes additional content in the book compared to the lectures.\n\n2. Coming from a CS background, which is to some degree binary thinking, this material is not. Discussion is all in 'possibilities', 'likeliness' and 'suggestions'. Be prepared to learn that language, since a Null hypothesis test still doesn't allow you to make a guarantee.\n\n3. As a language R and R-Studio is fine. It's clean and compact and serves a specific purpose, but if you're coming from Python, you may want to do things over there and then bring it over. Whatever works for you. I wrote everything from scratch R for the practice, I think it helped me when it came time for the Exams, since a lot of it was muscle memory at that point.\n\nGrade: A+ (in case that matters to you)HelpfulVery HardNeutral20 hrs/wk", "Methods of Applied StatisticsSummer 2022linkHigh quality course you want to take8/10/2022, 7:31 AMI enjoyed this course a lot and would recommend it to anyone. I had no intention of taking the data science courses, but I took this one because it was so well-reviewed and I am glad I did.\n\nThis is the high quality content you get access to by taking a program through a school like UIUC over something more questionable. Take advantage of it.\n\nThe workload is heavy, and, because the weeks follow the same format, it does feel a bit repetitive which made the class feel like more work than some other courses I'd taken. Some other reviews have described this class as a \"slog\", and, while I loved the class, that is an accurate description. I felt I did not get a single day off the entire semester. I would finish one week, and I knew I would fall behind if I didn't immediately start the following. Being a 12 week term, though, you just have to power through it.\n\nOther comments about \"class management\" being lesser in Summer 2022 are incredibly overstated. I really hope these do not sway someone to not take the class. None of the issues people highlighted impacted my learning experience, and all of them were easily resolved with the tiniest bit of common sense and independent thought: not getting your question answered on Campuswire? There are office hours literally every day. Noticed that the homework for this week still says Summer 2021? It's obviously an oversight so just start working on it instead of waiting for an email from the professor saying so.\n\nHighly recommend.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked20 hrs/wk", "Methods of Applied StatisticsSummer 2022linkGreat Course8/9/2022, 11:12 AMGreat Course that does a great job at being straight to the point and teaching it in an easy to digest way where things build on top of each other. \n\nWork load is consistent across the semester. The times listed for each week are very accurate.  I spent close to 10 hours per work and about 20-30 hours during project weeks.   The consistent work load is nice as you know what to expect week to week but can make it hard to get ahead and doesn't give you much breathing room if you plan to do special things during the  summer i.e. (vacations, weddings, trips,etc...). \n\nQuizzes are almost like small MPs that require you to write and execute code.  Quizzes take more time than your average quiz in other classes.  Exams are a direct reflection of the quizzes which makes it very easy to study for and the exams are very fair besides dealing with ProctorU issues.\n\nOne nice thing was that the professor films new weekly videos which are fresh rather than recycled content from 3+ years. \n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is I don't think this was the best semester for this course from a support perspective.  I think the batch of TA's for this go around weren't as responsive as years past.  The TA's were also commonly 2-3 weeks behind on grading which makes homework tougher as homework's recycles content from prior week so if you got something wrong from week 8, you might miss points on a similar problem in week 10 as you don't have direct feedback on what you did wrong yet.  Deadlines were commonly pushed back because the TA's had yet to add the assignment to gradescope or Coursera. \nI also think the professor was dealing with personal issues at the time.  All in all, I think this is only an issue that this semester will have to face and should be better in the future. \n\nGreat course, take it if you want to take PSL or want to get into Data Science.HelpfulHardLiked12 hrs/wk", "Methods of Applied StatisticsSummer 2022linkExcellent content, moves quickly, some logistics hiccups8/7/2022, 8:00 AMContent was really strong throughout - the course moves quickly, given the typical 12-week summer semester, but each week builds on prior weeks and concepts are generally well explained. Between lecture videos, the (free) online textbook, and frequent forum posts between classmates, there are plenty of resources to get a really solid understanding of the material.\n\nThis was my first course in the MCS program, so it's tough to judge the level of difficulty and workload expectations, but I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up as one of my more time-consuming classes. New content was presented during 8 of 12 weeks (only exceptions were exam and project weeks). Each of those 8 weeks had a practice quiz, a graded quiz, and a homework, the latter of which easily took 10+ hours some weeks - especially in the first half of the course (granted, I came in without any background in R).\n\nExam weeks were probably the only real breaks, with both projects taking as much time as a normal homework/lecture week. And while the projects involved a lot of work, they were possibly the best part of the course - the first was a structured simulation assignment, similar to a weekly homework but more time consuming and a little more open ended. The second, the only group project, was a wide-open data analysis project with a dataset of your choice.\n\nLastly, while this was a fantastic class overall, there were some issues with course administration in the second half of the course that were both unexpected and - judging by reviews from prior years - unusual for this professor.\n\n- Assignment portals weren't opened until a matter of hours before the deadline, and sometimes after the deadline (extension were ultimately given in those cases, but communication was non-existent - even the TAs were out of the loop). \n\n- Though my ProctorU experiences were uneventful, others mentioned a whole host of problems, such as the copy-paste functionality unexpectedly disabled during the second exam and proctors being unaware we were allowed (and required) to have RStudio open for the exams.\n\n- Assignment feedback was both poor quality and late: grading was ridiculously lenient in some cases, and questionably stringent in others (for example, many of us were docked points in one assignment for not displaying plots side by side for comparison, even though this was never mentioned as a requirement...meanwhile, others who did display their plots side by side on the same problem were docked points for having plots that were too small!). We usually had around half of our assignments graded before each exam, and homework solutions usually weren't posted until a month after the deadline.\n\nFantastic course overall, would highly recommend especially as an intro class to the MCS program - but I hope the program administrators and the professor take their feedback seriously this year, as the course administration was lacking and extremely unprofessional, and unnecessarily stressful as a result.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked14 hrs/wk", "Methods of Applied StatisticsSummer 2022linkWell organized course8/6/2022, 11:39 AMI would highly recommend this course if you are new to Statistical concepts.

I cannot recommend this strongly enough.  It is a very well-structured class that is a TON of work, but covers basics you will use in many classes throughout the program.  You will work through a broad swath of introductory statistics, plus you will be led (week-by-week) the basics of the R programming language.\n\nMy undergraduate degree was in math, but it had been many years (20+) since doing any advanced statistics, so I welcomed the refresher.  I had little to no experience with R.  So, I was spending 25+ hours per week, easy, between the every-week quizzes (which were far more work than the word \"quiz\" implies) and every-week homework (hours and hours). The exams, while less work than the quizzes, were still not easy (you have to work fast for the full hour -- and you have to deal with ProctorU, ugh), and both projects were quite time-consuming. There were no \"easy\" weeks, no \"catchup\" weeks.  It's a steady slog of hours and hours of work.  Do not allow yourself to get behind!!  But if you understand all that going in, it's a really good class.\n\nPerhaps if you're more familiar with R or have used statistics more recently, you can spend slightly less time on the homeworks and quizzes, but I suspect it will still be a lot of work.

{"course_title": "Natural Language Processing", "course_name": "CS 447", "details": ["Natural Language ProcessingFall 2023linkChallenging but well-designed course1/30/2024, 9:36 AMOVERVIEW \n\nThis course provides a comprehensive overview of various topics within the sphere of NLP. In this class you'll learn about very basic language models such as unigram and bigram models and build you way up to implementing neural network architectures.\n\nIt consists of lectures, weekly quizzes, weekly peer-reviewed questions, 4 homework assignments, and a final literature review if you're taking the 4 credit hour version.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nB.S. in Economics & Minor in CS\n30 hr/week data science internship\nFirst semester in the program\n\nOVERALL \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nI started off not liking this course very much and was prepared to give it an average if not below average rating. But by the end I was pleasantly surprised with how well-designed it was and felt like I got a lot of value out of it. The combination of well-designed homework assignments and a literature review in place of exams give this course a very unique feel compared to others in the program.\n\nA few pieces of advice I would share are: 1) get started on the homework assignments as early as possible; you may find yourself stuck in which case you can usually get great help during office hours, but if you wait until the last minute they will likely be full. 2) carefully consider the quiz questions and review the textbook chapters as these can be very tricky in terms of their wording. 3) take the literature review seriously and the knowledge you gain alone with be worth the price of the whole course. \n\nLECTURES \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThe lectures for this course stand out as being the worst aspect of this course. This is partially due to a boring and unrehearsed lecturing style from the professor, but it's mostly due to the fact that the lectures do not focus enough on topics that the student needs to be successful in the class. There are linguistic topics that are of course relevant to know for NLP, but these are covered seemingly at the expense of practical examples that dominate the homework assignments. I had to do a lot of self-learning outside of the course to understand how to complete the homework assignments in particular.\n\nQUIZZES \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThe quizzes for this course are weekly and focus on material (mostly) covered in the lectures. These are not classic spam-submit quizzes, so you only really have one chance to get it right. These were very challenging and there were nuances with several questions that made them feel a bit unfair. Fortunately these are not weighted heavily, but you'll want to make sure you have a solid understanding of the material before submitting for the deadline.\n\nPEER-REVIEWED QUESTIONS \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThe peer-reviewed questions were weekly and typically asked a few questions related to the week's content. I actually liked these questions for the most part, as they were very thought-provoking and challenged me to engage more with the material. At the same time, some of these actually took a significant amount of time (3 hours) to complete, which contributes to the workload I listed for this course. They also feel somewhat hollow as they're never actually graded by the course staff so don't expect great feedback.\n\nHOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThe homework assignments were one of the highlights of this course for me. They were extremely well-designed and allow you to build some really cool things. That being said, these deserve a warning as they take a HUGE amount of time to complete. The first homework in particular took me probably 20 hours to complete in its entirety. I also feel like it's worth noting here that these would be rated higher if I didn't feel so lost trying to complete some of them. I feel like more practical examples in the lecture would have helped; but trying to complete these assignments without getting much from the lectures was a chore. Still, these are very well-designed and you have a lot of time to complete them (3 weeks), so they're one of the aspects of the course to look forward to.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThis course requires you to complete a literature review in lieu of exams. This was actually a welcome change from the typical ProctorU garbage. Moreover, since the literature review can be about a topic of your choosing within the realm of NLP, it was actually a great chance to engage with the material I had been learning throughout the semester in a way that didn't feel as unnatural as regurgitating information on an exam. If you take this seriously, you can seriously learn a lot so I would recommend you do. Grading on this assignment was also pretty lax since it was only peer-graded. This is nice, but at the same time I would echo other sentiments that getting some degree of feedback from the course staff would have made this better. Still, probably the best part of the course. It's nice to be treated like grad students. \n\nCOURSE STAFF/SUPPORT \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe course staff ran the class extremely well throughout the semester. TA's and the professor were all active on Campuswire and responded to any questions/issues fairly quickly. Unlike some other courses (Text Information Systems), this course ran like a well-oiled machine with very few minor hiccups along the way.HelpfulHardLiked18 hrs/wk", "Natural Language ProcessingFall 2023linkLecture-Heavy, but good quality12/9/2023, 3:57 PMTL;DR: take this class only if you think you'd be interested in NLP and have ~15 hours/week to spare to further that interest. \n\nI took this class with CS410, and this class covers some of what's covered in that class, but it is much harder and much more rewarding in my opinion. I'd say lectures are split 50/50 between NLP architectures (transformers, neural nets, etc.) and fundamental linguistics. I think this is a good balance between the fundamentals that underpin lots of NLP research and the practical tools that are being used today. \n\n\nLectures:\nI think the lectures could use some work. Professor Hockenmaier clearly knows her stuff and is great at explaining the linguistics half of the class, but like many other reviews say, she isn't the most concise or articulate when she's delving deep into the technical weeds of a certain model or tool or something. I don't expect any professor to be able to make complex statistics intuitive, but just know that you will need to do a lot of separate learning if you want to understand the final 20% of the more technical subjects. \n\nAssignments/Grades:\nGrades were split between 4 things: weekly peer reviewed questions, weekly quizzes, 4 MPs, and a literature review. Weekly peer reviewed questions were leniently graded, and always focused on the linguistic topics that were discussed in that weeks lectures. I thought they were well designed and helped me build a better intuition for these topics. The weekly quizzes were pretty fair but still very challenging. You will not get a good grade unless you have watched the lectures thoroughly. The MPs are your chance to apply the technical side of the lectures. They are are very well documented, but can still be a little frustrating and finicky at times. Campuswire is usually helpful in these situations.\n\nThe final project: \nThe literature review for the final project is very open ended and very substantial. Its a 7-8 page research review on an NLP topic of your choosing. I enjoyed having an assignment that forced me to dig deeper into research literature on a particularly hot topic right now, but it is VERY substantial. Grading is fairly lenient, but it is still nothing to underestimate. \n\nLogistics: \nThis class ran like clockwork, with only one hiccup being the due date for the final project being later than possible on the Coursera. The due date ended up getting pushed earlier by a few days, which wasn't a huge deal. Professor Hockenmaier was very apologetic and I think she genuinely tried her best to be fair in that situation. Otherwise its pretty easy to get into a good routine with this class. The Campuswire is also great. The professor is very active there along with the campus staff, and my cohort had lots of people sharing common bugs in the MPs which was helpful for debugging. \n\n\nOverall:\nThis is a pretty high quality course with a good professor, a well designed syllabus, and an excellent mix of assignments to complement the lectures. Having no exams is a huge bonus and stress reliever as well.  Lectures are very dense and understanding them is crucial for good performance in the class overall. This, in addition to the very open ended and substantial literature review, is why I would only recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in NLP. If you aren't, then you are not going to enjoy the lectures, you're going to hate the assignments, and the literature review will be a nightmare.HelpfulHardLiked15 hrs/wk", "Natural Language ProcessingFall 2022linkVery good course on linguistics with some practical work on deep learning for NLP12/25/2022, 5:27 PMThis course mixes classical NLP with deep learning approaches.

I asked many questions on Campuswire and got replies within hours, even on weekends. \n* Lectures offer broad coverage. \n* Really good book to accompany lectures (Jurafsky et al, you'll find it online for free). Has some of the best explanation of Transformer architectures I have ever seen.  \n* Literature Review encourages you to read research papers and get some amount of depth in the topic you chose (7 are offered with papers, but you can choose your own, as I did). \n* HW is really well structured. DL problems have a slight feel of fill-in-the-blanks, because dataloaders and data cleaning is done for you. But you'll be pretty busy building and training the models anyways. All done in Jupyter and really helpful unit tests exist to help you track progress and debug your work. \n* Professor (Julia Hockenmeyer) is very present on Campuswire and frequent office hours with her and TAs are available (I barely attended any, because time zone issues, see below.

I was able to catch up somewhat towards the end. \n* I didn't really like the peer reviews. Sometimes grading criteria weren't very clear and even if so they felt a bit like an ordeal and didn't add greatly to my learning experience. The feedback you get is anyways rather superficial (graders only tick boxes). \n* Literature review was PR only, so you don't really get any feedback on your writing, style, scientific content. So, you spend a lot of time reading and writing and can learn a lot, but you are basically on your own. One could at least have discussed them in class or in groups for some live feedback. \n* Timing of office hours not ideal for working professionals with family in European time zones. \n\nGENERAL:\n* The course is rather front-loaded and starts with a hefty load of 3h 40min of lectures in week two. Workload peaks around week 7-8 when everything seems to be due at the same time (see above). HW 1 and 3 were the most time consuming for me (with previous knowledge on DL in computer vision). \n* No exams (no ProctorU, yay!). Marks are a mix of weekly quizzes, peer reviews, home work assignments and literature review. \n* Make no mistake. The main part of the lectures, quizzes, PRs is on lingustics, not DL. The latter (DL) however dominates the HW, which is a bit of a mismatch between theory and practice. \n\nVERDICT:\n* A course which offers a broad coverage of NLP (including some general CS topics like hidden markov models, Bayesian models, transducers, dynamic programming) as well as more recent deep learning models applied to NLP (incl. LSTM with Bahdanau attention and Transformers). Given the breadth the course often skims over some topics a bit superficially, but you can go into more depth if you want to.HelpfulHardLiked20 hrs/wk", "Natural Language ProcessingFall 2022linkGood Course12/18/2022, 3:41 AMOverall, a solid course. I have a background in linguistics, so this was up my alley. \n\nThe lectures were okay. I felt like the content was good and interesting but it was just the professor reading from the powerpoint slides. The difficult concepts, that actually required in-depth explanations, were just glossed over. That was frustrating. The only reason I didn't choose 'Strongly Liked' was I thought the lecture quality warranted a step down.\n\nThe homework generally did a good job of making sure you understood the concepts from the week of lectures. They were peer graded and the grading was relatively loose, so it was easy to achieve high marks on this part.\n\nThe projects were well-structured and difficult. The second two (related to neural networks) were quite challenging. I felt I really had to really understand the problem to get the right answers for these. Working with google Colab presented some unique challenges and I ended up purchasing a $10/mo package to get through the projects quicker. Additionally, working with GPUs you'll get some weird errors. Although generally the TAs were quick to respond, I lost some points due to a bizarre (GPU specific) error that was not worth my time to fix. Start your projects early, which allows you to give yourself time to get stuck. Campuswire was pretty active for people who got stuck.\n\nThe research paper was painful. I learned a lot in the process of writing mine. Even though I spent a significant amount of energy and time on it, it was not a great paper. However, it was peer-reviewed and the evaluation parameters were well structured so I ended up doing well on it. The other papers I reviewed were generally impressive and well-written.\n\nThe quizzes were good too-- you had to definitely do the readings. \n\nI didn't do any office hours, so can't speak to that. \n\nExpected grade: AHelpfulHardLiked14 hrs/wk", "Natural Language ProcessingFall 2022linkFantastic in every regard - exactly what the MCS program needs12/12/2022, 5:28 PMI took this class alongside CS 410 (Text Information Systems) this fall, and while 410 was still a solid class, 447 (NLP) was far and away the better course. I took an NLP class during undergrad, but UIUC's CS 447 goes much further. It has a heavy emphasis on linguistics, but the MPs are an excellent complement and give you a chance to practice some of the key concepts. Logistics are surprisingly polished especially given that this is only the second year NLP has been offered online through the MCS program - autograders work perfectly, Gradescope to Coursera integration is easy to understand and didn't cause any problems, MP environments are handled through free CoLab notebooks.\n\nThe MPs are probably the best part of the course. They're extremely challenging, but broken into bite-sized chunks with lots of support available (both in the form of pre-written \"sanity checks\" - autograding functions - and TA support via Campuswire). Most of them use PyTorch and give you exposure to NLP deep learning algorithms, which are the preferred/state-of-the-art method of choice for many NLP tasks today. They strengthen your Python skills but don't require you to be an absolute expert in Python coming into the course. There are only four across the semester, with plenty of time available for each.\n\nTA and professor support was definitely another plus. Office hours weren't too busy unless an MP was due in the next week. Campuswire was monitored frequently and the TAs would often answer specific debugging questions in a matter of minutes (shout-out to Marc, the TA who must've answered 500 questions during the semester).\n\nIn comparison to CS 410, which tended to jump around a bit and gloss over the \"exciting\" stuff (i.e., introduced key concepts at a high-level but glossed over implementation), CS 447 spent much more time teaching how specific concepts were implemented in practice - dependency parsing had a whole lecture and PowerPoint deck dedicated to a step-by-step example.\n\nLastly, the workload is manageable (heavy, but distributed nicely) and grading is very fair. No exams and a major literature review requirement made this course truly feel like grad school. Quizzes are challenging but carry a low weight toward your final grade, and the remaining grade is derived from factors you can completely control if you invest enough time (MPs + peer-reviewed questions & responses). Truly an excellent class in all regards - content, logistics, and practicality.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked18 hrs/wk", "Natural Language ProcessingFall 2021linkIncredible course12/12/2021, 3:10 AMWhat a marvel of a course. The homeworks are incredibly well-designed and really, really help you apply and test your knowledge.

Quizzes are massively beneficial to test your conceptual understanding of course material. You will grow as an engineer writing the literature review if you put effort into it.\n\nFall 2021 was the first time this course was offered, and while there were some logistical hiccups, the course material itself is great.

Compared to some other NLP offerings out there it focuses more on linguistics, which I found refreshing. The weekly quizzes were decently challenging and required critical thought. \n\nThere were 4 MPs and a final literature review of 4-5 papers in your choice of NLP topic. I thought this was a nice change of pace from final projects in other courses. I would urge you to take the review seriously if you take the class. It is a great opportunity to learn how to read and evaluate papers, write in an academic/technical fashion, and dive into a topic of particular interest.\n\nThe biggest con is lecture quality; they are somewhat inconsistent. I think they could be more rehearsed and the slides a bit more fleshed out. The accompanying text (https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) is good, though it can be dense. Also, some of the content was not covered in the book, though this was rare.\n\nSupport was good, with Prof. Hockenmaier and the TAs being responsive and helpful. Overall a good class, and given that this was the first large-scale rollout of the course, some of the issues were to be expected. As a side note, Stanford's CS224n is a great companion course that covers deep learning in NLP in more depth - very complementary to the breadth of CS477.HelpfulMediumLiked8 hrs/wk", "Natural Language ProcessingSpring 2021linkNot a bad course11/15/2021, 7:24 PMPros:\n\n- The material itself is pretty interesting but undermined by poor lecture quality.\n\n- The programming assignments are well-designed and challenging.

The coding assignments are all done from scratch, which is great for developing intuition of an algorithm. \n\nThe course is new on Coursera and the course staff had not updated the auto-generated time estimates for effort required each week at the start of the semester. You should ignore those estimates and expect 30 hours per week for videos, readings (for many topics this is necessary to answer quiz questions) and for doing the programming assignments.  Many people spent 60 hrs for a single programming assignment.\n\nThis course follows a slightly different format to other Coursera classes. There are no exams or practice quizzes, so every quiz score impacts your overall grade. Other courses use quizzes to provide feedback on conceptual understanding, that is not available online via Coursera. You must use CampusWire, Office Hours or the alternative strategy described below.\n\nI was eventually able to apply a self-directed learning strategy that involved the following steps:\n\nDay 1\n1. (1hr) Reading through the Quiz questions and guessing at answers.\n2. (1-3hrs) Reading through all lecture slide decks to be exposed to terminology and attempt at understanding.\n3. Review all Quiz answer options and revise \n\nDay 2 (breaking over days with sleep helped me)\n4. Watch 1-2 Lecture videos (at higher speed if you prefer)\n5. Review related Quiz questions\n\nDay 3 (sleep again helps solidify)\n6. Go through every Quiz question and be able to answer why a certain option is not correct or correct (if you are uncertain why a certain answer is not correct, because something else seems obviously correct, then dip back into lecture material.)\n\nOther useful resources:\n- PDF text of the book https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/\n- Jurafsky lectures https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK8HbD2sPcUIDfQ7zmBarMYv\n\nAs for Peer Review questions, the above process can work as well. Just be sure to read through the questions and answer exactly what is specified, most questions require 2-3 sub components for a full score.\n\nOne last point, the course is self-contained, meaning you don't need prior knowledge in Deep Learning, those concepts are covered. You should definitely be comfortable with Python, Python debugging and writing reasonably efficient Python code (it's easy to make the autograder fail due to memory or time constraints). Prior exposure to Numpy and PyTorch will also help.\n\nPersonally, I took this course with 410 Text Information Systems and found the two courses paired well. Often times the same concept was discussed in different ways, which greatly aided in reinforcement. The time commitment for 410 is less, probably 5-10 hrs most weeks and occasionally 15 hrs.\n\nThanks for reading this longish review and I hope it helps!HelpfulHardStrongly Liked30 hrs/wk"]}

That was a mistake.\n\nAs others have noted, the instructor is checked out, but the same is largely true of the TA. \n\nThat actually wouldn't be an issue for me if the course were set up competently such that it could run itself \u2014 that is, if the materials were bug-free. No such luck.\n\nThe midterm was misgraded, some of the machine problems and quizzes had bugs in their autograding scripts that required tedious back-and-forth with TAs to fix, and in general there has been a consistent lack of responsiveness from course staff. One assignment's non-functional autograder wasn't fixed until more than two months after staff were notified it was broken via Piazza.\n \nBy the time we had completed Week 10, assignments from Weeks 3, 4, and 6 remained ungraded. Student inquiries regarding these delays on Piazza went completely unacknowledged.\n\nRe. the midterm: Since it was mis-graded, the feedback provided via Coursera was erroneous -- this has not been fixed.

When reminded and asked for an updated ETA, she offered one... then again quietly ignored her estimated delivery date.

The professor doesn't do anything in the class.  The lectures are from a professor that quit teaching the class years ago.  I saw like 2 or 3 comments in Piazza on some questions students had.  The answers looked like text responses from a child in grade school and offered zero help to the student.  The TAs on the other hand were extremely helpful.  They did sort of vanish around finals week as I am assuming they too had finals, but it was unfortunate as I saw a lot of students questions around the last two assignments go unanswered.\n\nSo let's talk now about the assignments.  They are all C++ where you usually just need to implement a few stub functions.  You won't be using C++ constructs like classes, so if you have C experience that will be good.  If you have neither, I would brush up before starting this class.  I can imagine if you don't it can be a struggle to learn it on the fly.\n\nAltogether were I think 4 written homeworks where you had to answer some questions (last one required some coding), 3 MPs and a final project that was really just an expanded MP.  The grading on the MPs seemed to be very lenient. The midterm was not too difficult.  The final had a multiple choice and a written component.  The written component seemed to be graded pretty tough, and from that I bombed the final.  All that being said, still had a comfortable A regardless if they had curved the grades or not (which I am not sure if they did or not). \n\nEven though the lectures are a little older, the concepts are still relevant. I really liked the class as I am more focused on pure CS type courses as opposed to the plethora of data science classes that are offered. All in all, it seems like this class produced different experiences for different students.  In the end, I really enjoyed the class.  It could be because I enjoy the subject, and as such I do not look to discredit other reviews as it seems quite a few other students, especially in the Spring 2022 semester had a terrible experience.

Grading is arbitrary and capricious.\n\nLecture slides and quizzes literally have incorrect and/or incomplete formulas and answers that are never explained and are never corrected. Formulas also use inconsistent variable names and have variables that are never explained. The exams then test over these concepts. The projects have ambiguous instructions and poorly documented code, and the rubrics and tests are decided after the projects are submitted (and are never released to the students). The projects also involve esoteric concepts from physics that the students are supposed to be simulating that are never adequately explained and require, on average, 10-20 hours just to figure out how these concepts work and how they are connected with the provided functions. For most of the assignments, the code that is given to students is provided broken and does not compile or causes a segfault when run, making debugging extremely difficult. Autograders for assignments reject correct answers. The final exam was 25% of the total course grade, and it did not test any problems that were ever explained. Moreover, the staff informed the students that the final exam covered the entire course (~15 sections), when in fact it only covered 3 or 4.\n\nThe students that do well in this course have already taken parallel programming. They can recognize the instructors' mistakes and have better intuition in predicting what the assignment rubrics might look like.

The threshold for an A was then reduced, making this effect even more pronounced.\n\nPer the syllabus, the default cutoffs are: A (4.0): 85%; B (3.0): 70%; C (2.0): 60%.

They will make you a better programmer and you will find yourself writing more cache-friendly and efficient code after this class.\n\nTake this class if you are interested in a CS-intensive difficult course.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked15 hrs/wk", "Parallel ProgrammingSpring 2021linkGood course, bad prof11/17/2021, 1:56 PMPositives:\n\nThe lectures were pretty good. I especially liked the early lectures about computer architecture, covering stuff like cache levels, writing code that accesses caches efficiently, and the massive speedups that are sometimes seen from this. One of the MPs about writing code that accesses the cache efficiently was cool.\n\nThe midterm and final were challenging and covered the material well.\n\nNegatives:\n\nProfessor Rauchwerger gave the impression that he did not care about the class in the slightest. He was mostly inactive on course forums, did not seem to know what was going on - for instance, requiring students to provide a lot of context regarding MPs or quizzes in order for him to be able to answer questions, he seemed to regularly arrive ~10 minutes late to office hours, etc.\n\nOne of two TAs I talked to didn't know the course material well. The other one was alright. \n\nOne of the MPs given to us was to complete part of a simulation written as part of a PhD project. The code quality of this MP was pretty bad, the instructions were not all that clear, and completing the MP did not feel relevant. It was mostly about understanding the mechanics of a specific library, and understanding what/how the simulation was attempting to do.\n\nThere were loads of technical difficulties having to do with the campus cluster, especially at the beginning of the semester. This led to several weeks, nearing a month if I recall correctly, of delay with the first MP, which fortunately was just about getting familiar with the campus cluster and did not require any substantial work. It became clear that no one in the staff was proficient with the tools used on the campus cluster to run the MPs, which meant, for instance, that small updates that needed to be made to shell scripts that ran our MPs took a long time to be done.HelpfulHardDisliked10 hrs/wk", "Parallel ProgrammingSpring 2021linkgood material, absent professor11/15/2021, 11:21 AMThis course covers the fundamentals of programming on multi-core and multi-processor computing systems in both shared memory systems and distributed memory systems using APIs such as OpenMP, Pthreads, MPI, and Charm++ (although Charm++ is only covered in lecture).  Essentially all modern processors are multi-core, so this is a necessity in today's programming environment.  You'll be programming fairly close to the metal like in a systems programming or computer architecture course.  The amount of code written will be fairly short, but requires great attention to detail on the minutia to do it correctly or else your runtimes will skyrocket and runaway.\n\nThe course consists of:\n   - weekly quiz\n   - midterm exam\n   - final exam\n   - 4 machine problems\n   - Final project with report (e.g. an MP of your choosing)\n\nThe course was originally taught for many years by Dr. Laxmikant Kale, who is also the inventor/developer of charm++, but he recently retired from teaching.  His video lectures are still used as the primary teaching material for the course.  Dr. Lawrence Rauschwerger is now the instructor assigned to the course.\n\nDr. Kale's lecture videos are quite well presented and informative, but they also teach the subject from the professor's point of view.  so expect some unique insight on some topics, while not getting the expected on others.  The early lectures deal with historical use of computer processors and their evolution through the years.  Lectures in the middle of the course deal with strategies of divide and conquer methods to parallelize algorithms for computing.  Lectures at the end of the course focus on industry application such as the GPU.\n\nThe emphasis of the course is how to best use data in the processor's cache (L1, L2, L3) to maximize performance and minimize overhead.  The math required is fingers and toes variety arithmetic, and basic linear algebra such as multiplying matrices.  The programming assignments are done in C++, but C programming as used in systems programming, is enough.  You can write object oriented code if you like, but it is not required to do the assignments.  It's more important to understand the fundamentals of the C/C++ language such as pointers, references, bitwise operators, pass by reference, unions, bitfields, storage capacities of data types, two's complement, etc...  The best preparation for this course would be systems programming and/or a course in computer architecture such as assembler programming (but not required).\n\nEach machine problem involves doing work on a virtual machine running ubuntu linux provided by the school.  You write and modify the code until you reach the correct answer as provided by the auto-graders.  Once the code is fully debugged, you move it over the campus cluster (a supercomputing farm) where you run scalability benchmarks and write about your findings in a report which is submitted with your code.  There are about 5 questions, many of them based on theoretical concepts which you answer with charts and graphs to support your findings.  The total amount of code you write is on the short side, but it is a challenge to figure out how to best write the code to achieve the desired result.  There are multiple solutions, but only one is efficient.  You'll spend most of your time refactoring your code to find that most efficient solution - there is also a minimum spec you must meet to earn the 'A'.  The virtual machines in which you do your programming can only scale to 16 cores (processors) and will core dump if you try for more.  The campus cluster is used for benchmarking because it can scale to greater than 16 cores.  Most of your benchmarks will scale up to 40 cores.\n\nThe final project is essentially an MP which you can choose the topic as long as it's about parallel programming.  If you cannot come up with a topic, one will be assigned to you.  In our case, it was to implement a parallel sorting algorithm developed at the university.  It was a challenge mostly because our only information was the white paper describing the algorithm.  If you haven't read white papers before, beware they can be heavily math jargoned to the point of obfuscation.  i.e. if you don't live and breathe math, you might be lost.  It's another way of saying that math people aren't very good at the English language as some really basic things are stated in the most complicated ways possible.  But I digress....\n\nThe weekly quizzes are challenging, but not impossible.  Every time you take the quiz, the questions (and answers) are rotated.  This is a mechanism to discourage cheating.  If you're smart, you'll keep taking the quizzes until you get 100% correct on all the questions (including rotations), then record your answers for use as exam study guides.  You have unlimited number of attempts, but some quizzes might limit the number of attempts to 3 every 8 hours.  Plan your time accordingly.\n\nThe exams are divided into two sections.  The first section is multiple choice questions just like the quizzes.  The second part is essay.  The essay is a few questions like those found on the machine problems reports, but expanded into multiple parts with follow up questions.  These types of questions involved some proofs and basic derivations.  When you see these questions in the lectures or machine problems, take them seriously.  The exams were given in a single day window where students would download the exam at any time, complete the exam, then upload within the specified duration.  The download/upload time stamps were used to enforce exam duration.  If you exceeded the window, you lost points or failed the exam.  That's another way of saying, no ProctorU for this course.\n\nOverall, the professor was absent from the course.  I had to contact the university to find out who it was because his info was not in the syllabus and he very rarely participated on Piazza.  He's an old school line of thought and can get quite cranky.  The TA's all hated working for him, and often grumbled about it in office hours.  However, if you want to learn he's a good resource to explain the concepts of the course, but you have to come prepared with your questions well thought out before you pop into office hours with him.  He can be quite finicky about who and what he responds to, and it's not uncommon for him to demand you turn on your web camera so he can see you when you speak.  He's a classic absent minded professor in the respect that he doesn't pay attention to the dotted i's and crossed t's when it comes to the administrative duties of the course.  When it came to the midterm exam, less than 24 hours before the exam was given, nobody knew the format of the exam, not even the TA's.  So be warned of things like that.\n\nCaveats:\n\nThe campus cluster is a shared resource among many courses and researchers at the university.  Therefore, there will always be a heavy load of jobs in the queue.  The weekends have the worst traffic.  Although your benchmarks may take only a matter of seconds to execute, your submitted jobs may be stuck in the queue for several hours, or even days, before they are run.  Therefore it's critically important to fully debug your code before submitting to the campus cluster for benchmarking as you might not have time for a second chance.  The strategic best time to use the campus cluster is the weekdays at the wee hours of the night when everybody is asleep.  Try Wednesday morning at 2:00 AM central time.  In those wee hours, you can get benchmarks submitted and returned within a few minutes.  If you need to work fast, then plan on burning the midnight oil to get that availability.  the other phenomena I noticed is that after midnight Sunday night, the campus cluster went suddenly empty.  Many assignments are due on Sundays, including those for research, so once the deadline passes, the queue empties as nobody needs the jobs anymore.  So Mondays in the early hours of the morning would be another great time to use the cluster.\n\nAs stated earlier, the professor can be quite cranky.  Therefore, you'll need to spend a lot of time in office hours with the TA's.  This course typically doesn't have many TA's, so don't get on any of their bad sides.  The machine problem assignment sheets instructions can get vague in certain areas.  You'll need the TA's to provide clarity to the finer points so you can do the work.  Dr. Kale's lecture videos are mostly good, but some topics leave a little to be desired on the finer points.  You'll need TA's to fill in those blanks as well.\n\nOverall this is a good course, but could use some better participation from the instructor, and better organization of materials as some were left to rot until I bitched about it.\n\nkeys to success:\n\n- Do quizzes until you get 100% on all questions - including those that are rotated in/out with each attempt.  You'll need them as study guides for the exams.\n\n- Do get very familiar with the fundamental aspects of C/C++.  don't worry about object oriented stuff - it's not needed for this course.\n\n- Do brush up on linear algebra (multiply matrices, dot product, cross product, determinant).\n\n- Do visit office hours frequently to get clarity on assignments and lecture videos.\n\n- Do all your work on the virtual machines provided.  Best to have an Ubuntu linux computer to connect as you'll be using Github to send/receive code.\n\n- Do try to plan your schedule around the campus cluster availability.  That means working in the wee hours of the night on weekdays, and trying to avoid weekends.  The cluster queue empties each night, but occasionally some research students will clog the queue with 700+ jobs without notice - especially at the end of the semester.HelpfulHardLiked15 hrs/wk", "Parallel ProgrammingSpring 2020linkDifficult, but fulfilling course8/6/2021, 8:03 AMI came in unprepared with extremely little c++ experience and having never taken a linear algebra class.

I have taken 6 so far, and I learned the most from PSL. Professor Feng Liang is also one of the best and most responsible professors in the program, which makes the learning experience great.\n\nThis course covers most ML methods (except deep learning which was briefly discussed). This is a stats class, so there are lots of math. It could be overwhelming at first, but I spent time digesting them following the lecture videos and tried to derive them myself. It turned out that the understanding of these ML models becomes much deeper. Also, the professor does a really good job organizing the course videos and going through them clearly.\n\nFurthermore, the professor is super active on Campuswire. She answers most questions within a day, which makes the learning experience really good. The professor also frequently publishes hints to the homework, reminders about deadlines, and even a kind reminder of the daylight saving change to those outside the US so they know office hour shifts. Her responsibility and enthusiasm to teaching is really a treasure in this program.\n\nThere is no exam, but 5 programming assignments and 4 projects, which can be time consuming but all worth it. Students have the option to team up for doing homework, but I chose to do everything solo so that I gained the most out of it. I ended up not losing any point in all the homework.\n\nOverall, this is a highly recommended course if you really want to learn something.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked16 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2023linkVery solid graduate level computational stats and applied ML12/22/2023, 2:47 PMI didn't have much formal stats background, but as long as you're solid on linear algebra and calculus and patience, the concepts and lectures can be understood. I really enjoyed the projects and homework assignments, there was a nice emphasis on implementing algorithms like k-means, mixture models, splines, etc from scratch using numpy, which helps lead to a much more intuitive understanding of the machinery behind them. Highly recommend for those interested in data science and ML, I just landed my first major data scientist job and having just come out of this course I was very refreshed on the general stats, it helped greatly with technical interview!HelpfulHardLiked20 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2023linkHard, but SO worth it12/21/2023, 8:56 PMIf you have an affinity for statistics like I do, this class is one of the best classes you will probably take in this program. That being said, a few recommendations...\n\n1) Form a group. I joined a group at the beginning of the semester but the other people in my group kinda de facto just started doing the assignments on their own anyway, so it ended up tripling my load on this class. Moral of the story: find a group and meet with them to get your projects done.\n\n2) Don't be afraid to ask questions on Campuswire. The professor was quite active on the forums and was REALLY smart about all the content in the class. She's seriously an expert, and it shows. Also, the other students in the class will likely be able to answer your questions too.\n\n3) However, don't rely on the TA's. They were the weakest link of this class. Each time I joined their OH to ask questions, they either told me things I already knew, gave me unhelpful suggestions, or told me to go ask a different TA who they thought would be more likely to help (spoilers, they weren't). And that's assuming they would show up to their scheduled OH, which they didn't a few times without even notifying anyone. (To be fair, they later ended up rescheduling missed OH, but it's still very unhelpful when some students plan to make it to specific office hours.)\n\n4) The professor provides you with a Google Calendar that you can use to keep track of all TA and instructor OH and coding assignment and project deadlines. Definitely use it.\n\nAll in all, this was an incredible class. There were times during the semester where things I was learning in the class were immediately relevant in my day job. If you have a chance to take this class, it's absolutely worth it.HelpfulVery HardStrongly Liked20 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2023linkTour de force through statistical learning - a survival guide12/19/2023, 2:05 PMMost relevant things have been said about this course. Let me give a quick summary and some survival tips I wish I had known earlier. \n\n* It's been said before: Form a team! Else your workload will be double to say the least. \n* Python is now fully supported by the staff with all MPs and coding assignments available in both versions. Python is much more relevant to my work than R, so I wish I had started using that instead of R (in former years Python support wasn't available for all MPs). \n* The lectures are very relevant, but far too math oriented to be useful. While it is valuable to study the math, this is a bad way to start out and build an intuition. What worked for me was mostly to refer to: ISLR lectures on youtube (by Tibshirani and Hastie), some parts of Steve Brunton's lectures on SVD, lectures on Hidden Markov Models by Donald J Patterson. You can then listen to Prof. Feng's lectures if you want to. She provides a lot of really helpful external links, which you better be checking out!\n* I just wish to give credit to Prof. Feng and her TA team who are doing a fantastic job of creating a comprehensive machine learning course and seem to be working around the clock. A lot of OH were offered at times which are possible even for people overseas. They grade everything manually and run every bit of your code. \n* The course is very front-loaded for you (as far as math and lectures go) and very back-loaded for the TAs as a lot of coding assignments and projects become available in the second half of the course. Unfortunately, this meant that about half of the grades came in during the last week and even after the end of the course and you won't get feedback on your mistakes on those projects. \n\nOthers have said it already - this is a LOT to take in. You could also work 40 hours a week and not get bored. If you are looking for \"classical\" machine learning as in statistical learning (everything which is NOT a neural net), go for it! Clearly one of the top 500-lvl courses in the program which also feels like one.\n\nBefore this course I had taken STAT420 and NLP, which helped a bit with R and lectures through the first 2-3 weeks as well as with HMMs and Bayes' rule.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked18 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2023linkQuality material; mediocre execution12/14/2023, 10:18 AMIn simple terms, I learned a ton about machine learning through this course, although it's definitely from a statistics perspective more than a CS perspective. I never took Applied Machine Learning to compare it to, but due to other reviews on here suggesting to take this course rather than AML, that's what I did and I'm happy with what I learned. We built cool projects like predicting the price of a home based on its characteristics, as well as making a small movie recommender system.\n\nI did all of the projects in a group of 3. How this shook out was that the leader of the group and I did most of the work, but the third person definitely contributed. I'm very thankful for this group, because I would not have wanted to do it all on my own given the other courses I took at the same time (see Context section below). There were a ton of assignments.\n\nUnfortunately, the worst thing about this course is the lectures. In essence, the professor focuses on the derivations of the concepts, rather than teaching intuition and understanding. Thankfully there are other learning materials online to supplement, but it wasn't fun listening to (at times useless) lectures on the mathematical derivation of a particular method only to have to go learn what it is actually used for elsewhere. That being said, I really did learn a ton, just comparatively less from the lectures.\n\nThe professor's forte is in R, but the Python support is there and growing for this course. We did the coding assignments in R, but then the projects in Python, which worked well for us. I had no R experience before this, and was able to pick it up quickly.\n\nContext:\n* I took this as a full-time student\n* Took this concurrently with Cloud Computing Capstone and Distributed Systems (was a ROUGH workload)\n* This was my final semester in the program\n* I had 5 years of professional software development experience prior to starting the program\n* Undergrad was in math (not CS)HelpfulMediumLiked10 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2023linkInteresting course with many topics12/5/2023, 12:41 AMA very engaging course with great staff. The assignments were really rewarding and you actually learn from them. Grading is generous. There might be too many topics, some of them are being touched only with a quiz which is forgetable.\n\nThe main downside for me was the teamwork. There are 9 assignments and you are encouraged to be in a team of 3 students. The outcome of this is was that we split the 9 assignments to 3 each and ended up to practicing a big part of the material. This happens because actually doing the assignments together is not practical because most of them are a progress in one direction and designed for one person. I wish there were 5-6 assignments and no teamwork.HelpfulMediumLiked6 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2022linkWell run course1/3/2023, 6:54 PMThe other reviews go a good job with details. \n\nI'll just add, you'll want to avoid pairing this course with anything difficult.

Even full time students who take 2 or more courses will find it difficult to enjoy the course unless you are able to put in 50-60 hours per week.\n\nPros:\n- A lot of topics covered so you get a glimpse of a lot of concepts.\n- The Prof. is almost always available on Campuswire and her office hours and code will help you get through the course.\n- Stats department has the best TAs and everyone helps you out.\n- Allowed to form teams for assignments and projects.\n- students can code in R or Python, Python starter code is not always provided though.\n- Only course in the MCS program that treats you like an adult, there is a 7 day late allowance which means you have 7*24 hours of flexibility to delay your submission. You use up the hours as you delay each submission.\n\nCons:\n- Too much content and very little time to understand the requirement of the assignments.\n- By week 4 I realized that the Coursera videos are NOT for average students, it caters to the PhD students who can understand all the math, others may have to rely on external content. \n- The prof. provides her code and that is pretty much the only way you can get full marks given the timeline.\n- A lot of repetitive instructions and links provided, you will take a few days to understand the system that the prof. is trying to create and you will feel overwhelmed at the amount of reference links she will provide.\n\nDos & Don'ts\n- If you are not already a champ on ML and DS topics and R/Python coding then FORM A TEAM from week 1 itself!! DO NOT venture alone.\n- If you want to just get by and tick off a 500 level requirement 15 hours/week with a team is doable else be ready for 50-60 hours/week if you are on your own.\n- Do not put off quizzes till the end as you will see by Week 6 that you are not progressing because of the number of deliverables.\n- Do not slack off weeks just because the deadline is later in the month, you will end up relying on your teammates and your experience will be ruined.HelpfulHardNeutral12 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2022linkVery intense but rewarding course12/17/2022, 9:53 AMI did all of the assignments/projects by myself but you can do them in groups!

A good group makes this course manageable.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2022linkDifficult but rewarding course12/14/2022, 11:20 PMWhen I looked at the first quiz and assignment in this course, I seriously considered dropping it since even with STAT 420, the statistics knowledge needed seemed really advanced. (Although, I took STAT 420 all the way back in Summer 2020 so it wasn't fresh in my mind). Ultimately, though, I'm glad I stuck with this course. Doing the projects has given me a deeper knowledge and appreciation for different types of prediction models, even though I'm not pursuing a data science career.\n\n-Lectures: This was the weakest part of the course for me and I starting skipping them halfway through. The professor lectures as if she were teaching grad-level stats students, not grad-level CS students, and assumes you already know many concepts and equations. You can get the gist of what the algorithms she talks about do, but her explanations are largely mathematical derivations. She does not walk through any sample problems; it's just somewhat arbitrarily named variables flying everywhere. She does post sample code of how you would use these algorithms in R, which was helpful. The textbook also went into better detail, but I honestly didn't read most of it.\n\n-Quizzes: I didn't find these as difficult as some of the other students did. You only get 3 attempts, but there's no time limit and they're not due until the semester end. So if you don't rush through and take the time to reason through your answers, you should consistently get high scores on these. The first quiz is almost all math problems, but later quizzes mix in multiple choice and R code. Many hints are available on CampusWire, and some answers you can intuit without doing lots of work if you have a solid grasp on the concepts.\n\n-Coding Assignments and Projects: This was my favorite part of the course. They are challenging and graded pretty harshly, and eat up way more time than the Coursera suggested time would lead you to believe, but since a lot of them involve implementing the algorithms discussed in the lecture from scratch, they really test your understanding. You are allowed to use outside sources for help as long as you cite them, so you can hone your research skills as well. The professor also posts a bunch of sample code and ideas you can use in these. Most people worked in groups, but both assignments and projects are completely doable alone (I did this) as long as you can allocate enough time to work on it; at minimum I would try to start on it a week before the deadline. While technically you can use Python instead of R, I highly recommend against this. The prof clearly outlined from the outset that Python would not receive sample code or debugging help, and honestly, it's good to learn additional languages.\n\n-General observations: This course has a rigorous pace; the biggest \"crunch\" comes around the midway point, when the last assignment and first project are due in quick succession. There was a bit of crunch on the last project as well, but that was due to the instructions being released later than planned. Luckily, there are no midterms or finals. CampusWire is a must for this course, since the professor posted sample code and even some instructions for projects there exclusively. This is a mixed bag; the discussion on there is great and the professor is very responsive, with staff providing frequent office hours. However, the format causes essential posts to get buried, and posts with instructions on what to submit or grading criteria may get missed entirely if you didn't see them before they got buried. The prof's unwillingness to make this easier to navigate or also post the info on Coursera after multiple complaints was the worst part of the course. Overall, though, I would consider this an essential data science course that will give you some cool projects to expand upon and ideas to think about.HelpfulHardLiked10 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2022linkGood course12/14/2022, 9:55 AMThis course was an interesting look at a lot of machine learning algorithms and approaches to preparing data. How much you learn in this class depends largely on your approach. For this semester, Coding Assignments were 20% of the grade, Projects were 40%, and Quizzes were 40%.\n\nLectures and Readings:\n\nI found the lectures interesting sometimes, but most the time they were composed of equations upon equations. If you love math and derivations, you will absolutely love the lectures. For me, they were dry and hard to pay attention to and learn from. Luckily, the professor provides a ton of outside material to dive into. On top of that, she also makes a lot of posts on the class forum throughout the semester with useful info for lectures, projects, and quizzes. Unfortunately, there is so much material provided it's overwhelming.\n\nThe Stanford lectures were really helpful, especially earlier in the semester, but they hardly cover all the class material. I found myself looking up popular videos on YouTube for each algorithm to understand how each one worked, and some of these were very helpful. Each week with new material (which is most weeks but definitely not all), I spent several hours studying the material before doing assignments/projects/quizzes.\n\nCoding Assignments:\n\nYou put the math to work in these assignments. You are often asked to do your own derivations, though a lot of the work is done for you, especially if you wait until a lot of posts have been made on the class forum, and office hours covering the assignment have been posted. They probably took me 10-20 hours each.\n\nProjects:\n\nThis is the \"practical\" part of the course and you are asked to figure out how to meet certain benchmarks for prediction for projects 1-3. Like other people have noted these are largely recycled from Kaggle competitions, but they are modified in some way. The features you are given are more limited, for example, so you can't necessarily do what the winners of the Kaggle competitions did, though their approaches will help you.\n\nA ton of the work for these projects is preparing the data before running your model. I'm sure this is largely the case in industry, so it's helpful. You will be able to try several approaches. Largely, you are guided in some direction for which strategies to employ. Like the coding assignments, if you wait until there is a decent amount of discussion available, it will most likely provide you most of what you need to do. \n\nProject 1 took me about 45 hours (more on this later), 2 was about 25, 3 and 4 both around 20. Project 4 was a little different as we made a Shiny app that made recommendations for the user, but it wasn't too bad.\n\nWith every project, a few days after they are released, the professor released on the class forum \"What we have tried\" posts (sometimes multiple posts per project over the course of several days). These contain a ton of sample code to use for your project. They save a ton of time, but you will sacrifice a lot of opportunity for critical thinking for each project if you rely heavily on them, and even more if you turn to office hours and answers given there. Sometimes with the posts and office hours, you can gather every bit of code you need for each project, in some form.\n\nQuizzes:\n\nThe one thing I absolutely needed to study for were the quizzes. Some of them are quite long (one had 32 questions) and really test your understanding of the material. And despite the \"Quiz\" label, they are worth 40% of your grade. You normally get 3 attempts but some longer ones had more. I believe the professor was willing to give more attempts to those who asked, but I never had to do that. A lot of the questions for some quizzes are results from running R code, but there are also a lot of multiple choice, and select all that apply (usually tells you how many need to be selected). Quizzes can take a few minutes (the early ones) to several hours.\n\nPython vs R\n\nThis is where the real time difference comes from. The professor works in R, but allows Python as well. You can even do both, if you want (though I wasn't aware of anyone who did this). Because the professor works with R, all of the sample code provided will be in R. If you plan on doing your assignments or projects in Python, unless you are already quite familiar with data science and ML in Python, you will spend a ton of time doing them. This is why project 1 took me much longer. Even if you use all the tips and sample code in R, you will learn so much trying to do it in Python. I found, even, that sometimes if you did everything the professor said worked in R, it didn't quite work for meeting the benchmarks in Python. So I had to do extra work. In doing so, I really had to learn about ML strategies in Python. After initially attempting to do Project 2 in Python, I gave up and did everything else in R, leveraging the sample code from the professor. I tried to work on things myself, and did learn quite a bit, but in the end, for the other projects, I always turned to posts and office hours.\n\nProfessor and TAs:\n\nThe professor is extremely knowledgeable and a master in R. By far, she is the most responsive professor of any class I've had. I have no complaints.\n\nMaterial:\n\nEarly in the class was more or less a review of some stuff from STAT 420, supervised learning, bias-variance tradeoff, OLS regression and some issues and techniques associated with it, and some brief review of probability theory.\n\nYou get a ton of exposure to Lasso and Ridge regression in lectures, materials, and projects. Lots about regression trees, gradient boosting, random forest, XGBoost, Adaboost. Then, you move onto splines and smoothing splines.\n\nUnsupervised learning is introduced with a ton of concepts there, K-means/medioids, hierarchical clustering, mixture models, EM algorithm, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), Hidden Markov Models, Baum-Welch, Vitterbi.\n\nThen, you come back to supervised techniques including discriminant analysis (linear, quadratic and fisher) and Naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines.\n\nSVD and PCA are touched on. Loess, KNN, UBCF, IBCF. One project involved using regression techniques for sentiment classification, another taught you how to use time-series data for predictions of sales, another employed recommender systems. Lots of info about preparing data, creating dummy variables, scaling/normalization, etc... I can't go over it all as it was a lot.\n\nMy background and circumstances:\n\nMy background is not heavy in programming, but I am semi-comfortable with Python and I did come straight from STAT 420 into this class, so had some R under my belt as well. It was my 3rd semester in the MCS program, taking my 3rd and 4th classes. I did all assignments and project on my own.\n\nI took this class with CS 410 while working full time (40+ hours per week), but only M-Th, so I had F-Su usually to do school. I also got married in the middle of the semester and went on a two week honeymoon, so had about three weeks that I didn't work on any school. Needless to say, it was rough. I had almost no down time for 4.5 months, but I survived and expect to get an A. Without the wedding stuff I think PSL + CS 410 while working full time would have been perfectly doable, but maybe not ideal for learning everything you can in PSL. The classes do have some surprising overlap, but it won't really help save any time.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nYou do get late days (7 days total) for your assignments/projects. These are meant for extenuating circumstances, not mere procrastination. I had to use one after the honeymoon for project 2 (I actually forgot about them until I emailed the prof asking for more time) so they did come in handy. They total up the late time in hours.\n\nOverall, I liked the class and the professor, and plan to keep studying the materials from it.HelpfulHardLiked15 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2022linkConsistent Grind but Good12/12/2022, 6:00 PMThis course will make you work non-stop with not much breaks.   With 4 challenging coding assignments and 4 projects, I always felt like I had something due next week. But the work was worth it.  To sum up how you learn, the lectures and books take you through the algorithim that you are trying to solve, like classification and then it walks you through how different machine learning algorithms are derived from that problem.  This gives you a tense mathematical understanding of each of the core basic algorithms out there.   The homework then makes you apply one of these algorithms by writing the code for it.  The projects are recycled kaggle competitions that allow you to apply these methods and figure out different ways to maximize these algorithms and meet a threshold needed to achieve full points.  These thresholds are normally very high and hard to achieve and have a very specific way needed to achieve it.  This what was frustrating about this class.  A very high bar was always set which was difficult to achieve but then the answers were given out either directly on campuswire or through office hours.  Not being able to achieve the needed scores or figure out the homeworks on your own were deflating.  I think the professor could have done a slightly better job at teaching us to get us to that point or making the thresholds and assignments just a tad easier.  But what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger and this class definitely did that.  If you are in this program for data science then this is a must take.HelpfulHardLiked15 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2022linkRigid regression with unnecessary complications12/4/2022, 3:17 AMPractical Statistical Learning, also known as STAT 542, is a statistics course covering machine learning from a mathematician's point of view.  It covers most of the same algorithms as CS 441 Applied Machine Learning, but goes deep into the proofs and derivations and learn to implement the algorithms directly.  Emphasis is on the math formulas and their use, not so much the computer science aspect of vectorizing your code or other optimizations.  The math is tougher than the coding in this course.  You should be familiar with least squares, singular value decomposition, general matrix math (add, multiply, inverse), and basic elementary statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance, normal distribution, probability, Baye's theorem, ...).\n\nThe course content consists of:\n   - video lectures\n   - 10 quizzes (40%)\n   - 4 machine problems (20%)\n   - 4 projects (40%)\n\nFor this semester Feng Liang taught the course.  She knows the material like the back of her hand because it's been the same regimen for many years running.  She is very responsive on campuswire and is readily available in office hours, but she is also incredibly rigid/inflexible on matters that do not fit neatly in the box she built for this class.  For example, if you have external life events or circumstances recognized and supported by the university with documentation, the professor does not recognize them.  Her information about rules and regulations is out of date, and her knee-jerk response to anything she is not familiar with is to refuse/deny/ignore.  You must go to the administration to twist the arm of the professor to comply.  I had to do this more than once.  When in doubt, check the syllabus for resources on campus and check them out.  You'd be surprised what protections you have that are accommodated by the university.  You've been warned.\n\nWhenever there is something to be explained, I felt the professor always took the most complicated way to do it when a simpler concrete example would've sufficed.  If you want to go deep into the weeds on the math and derivations, she'll be more than happy to walk you through them, but if you want a straightforward or intuitive explanation without the exposition, you're not likely to get much out of her.  Often you'll hear the energy drop out of her voice and she'll say something along the lines of you'll have to study more.  Following the adage, \"give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.  Teach him to fish and you feed him for life\".  The professor has opted to give us fish rather than teach us to fish as she'll drop hints for the quizzes, and supply ample boilerplate code for the coding assignments.  As some other reviews have stated, some of these hints do practically do the assignment for you if you pay close attention to them.\n\nOffice hours were scheduled on weekday evenings and a bulk of the sessions (6) offered on the weekends.  All day Saturday and a few on Sunday afternoon.  There were no office hours on Mondays as that's the due date for assignments, but all other days of the week had at least one office hours session.  If you need help, it's best to consult office hours earlier in the week as those sessions are less crowded.  Plus, if you hit a snag, you have more opportunity to recover.  The most busy/crowded office hours was Saturday afternoon.  Plan accordingly.\n\nLecture content varies in length per week.  Some weeks are as little as 45 minutes while others are more than 2.5 hours.  The professor tends to start with math proofs/derivations and explain the point from there.  Many students, including myself, found these lectures insufficient to gain an intuition of the subject.  However, the professor does provide links to external resources explaining the same subjects - but not all weeks have external counterparts (EM anyone?).  Many of us used those external resources as a first viewing, then followed up with the professor's videos as she goes into the weeds on a few things where the other videos stop short, and since the quizzes contain questions on these weeds, you have to watch the professor's videos whether you like it or not.  \n\nQuizzes are tougher than other courses in the MCS and are largely based on the lecture videos.  Most other courses treat quizzes as a menial task you do just to collect a few points often giving you unlimited attempts and easy questions.  This course is closer to a traditional classroom experience in that the questions have a higher level of difficulty, you get very limited number of attempts, and many questions require computation.  The quizzes are not impossible, but you do have to take them seriously.  The professor does provide hints on campuswire, but sometimes those hints are difficult to decipher as they're often based on information not found anywhere else in the course, or use syntax you're not used to seeing.  The good news is that quizzes are not due until (almost) the last day of the semester.  You can choose the pace which you do the quizzes, but in most cases you'll be too busy to get more than 2 weeks ahead.  It's far easier to fall behind.  Even though there are only 10 quizzes, many students were still working on quizzes into the final week.\n\nProgramming language.  You can choose to code in either R or Python.  The official language of the course is R.  You can use Python if you'd like, but be aware the Python libraries have fewer features for statistics and plotting compared to R.  In this course you'll be asked for specific types of plots or computations, and in some situations Python just doesn't have the tool in the toolbox, meaning you'll have to write that code yourself.\n\nWhen asked on day 1 of the course, the professor said she and the TA's all know R, but only a few TA's know Python.  They can help to a limited degree.  She also provided sample code for Python equivalent to the starter code for R, but when you get to assignment 3, there was no more Python starter code.  Instead, there was a note telling us if we needed certain functions/libraries, we should wrap R commands in Python using a specified 3rd party translator.  In other words, she pulled the rug out from underneath you without warning.  After enough complaints, one of the TA's whipped out some Python starter code, but not until 24 hours before the deadline, which is way too late to be of use.   If you weren't confident enough in your Python skills, or didn't have the time to deal with said issues, then you had to switch to R and get up to speed on short notice to do the assignment.   There was zero sympathy from the professor.\n\nMy advice is only use Python if you are already very fluent in the language and comfortable troubleshooting issues on your own.  Otherwise, choose R.  The nature of the assignments in this course do not benefit from Python, so there's no major incentive to use it other than personal preference.  R is an older language and has it's quirks, but you do not need to learn very much to be functional, and the quantity of code you write will be small.\n\nThere are two types of programming assignments in this course:  coding assignment (machine problem) and project (bigger machine problem).\n\nThe coding assignments are focused on implementing a specific algorithm with emphasis on the math formula.  For example, implement lasso regularization.  Coding assignments restrict the libraries you can use and force you to write the explicit code.\n\nProjects, on the other hand, are high-level and emphasize using the algorithms in the context of machine learning.  You'll usually use the built-in algorithms to whatever language you chose (R or Python).  Projects are focused on doing prediction/regression/classification, hitting target benchmarks, then writing a report to analyze/explain the findings.  The professor does provide an ample amount of starter code and examples of how to solve the problem as she wants you to focus on the statistics aspect of the project, not the computer science nuts and bolts.  That's another way of saying that she'll freely give out help for computer science issues, but will dance around things a bit more if your question is about the math as she doesn't want to give away the answer.\n\nMany students decided to work in teams, which are allowed up to 3 people.  If you work in teams, then each team member must cite their contributions to the submitted work.  You can, and probably should, do the coding assignments on your own, but work in teams for the projects.  The projects are more time consuming than difficult.  You can do projects on your own if you prefer, but be warned if anything goes wrong, you'll have little margin for error on the schedule.  One significant mistake can be a train wreck with a heavy ripple effect for the rest of the course.  If you work in teams, you'll have a nice safety buffer and keep your sanity.\n\nOne challenge of the coding assignment is the instructions contain a number of typographical and grammatical errors.  Some will lead you down the wrong path causing you to think you've done something wrong in your code only to, after many hours of hair pulling and visiting office hours, realize it's a bug in the instructions.  That said, if you get stuck on something for more than an hour or two, visit office hours to ensure you're not being mislead.\n\nThe most difficult part of this course occurs around mid term with coding assignment 4.  This is also the only week where the professor's lectures don't have external counterparts.  The topics:  EM, Gaussian Mixture models, and Hidden Markov Model.  You've probably seen these before in CS 441, but in this class it almost requires you to put on your PhD math hat to do some derivations.  This is when the schedule has a kink in it as well as most assignments have a 2-week window between due dates, but during this particular week there is only 1-week until the first project is due.  So....short week, difficult subject without help, math gets tougher - are you getting the picture?   If there is ever a time to not fall behind, this is it.  If you fall behind during this week, you'll have a difficult time getting back on track as there's just too much to do the rest of the way.  that's why it's suggested to work in teams for the projects.\n\nThe professor does provide 7 \"late days\" to use at your disposal.  Technically, they're \"late hours\" as they're computed by the hour.  In essence, you can submit your assignments late up to 7 calendar days worth of hours.  The late time is automatically deducted from your allotment based on the timestamp when you submitted (if you submit late).  However, if you use up your late days, from that point on any assignments submitted late will not be accepted (scored as zero).  No sympathy from the professor as she expects 7 days to be enough to cover almost anything that can possibly happen in life (auto accident with hospital stay, death in the family, flood of the earth, etc...).  I'm not exaggerating.\n\nFinally, if you weren't confident in your machine learning skills from CS 441 then you should be reasonably proficient by the end of this course.  R is an older language with a few quirks you'll have to deal with, but once you've mapped them out, coding is fairly easy and compact.  R has a lot of plotting options to dissect your data and analyze it.\n\nKeys to success:\n\n- Do NOT procrastinate.  Once the first coding assignment is released, there is no down time for the rest of the semester.\n\n- Try to submit everything on time so you don't use up your late days allowance.  Using late days won't result in scoring penalty, but using them means you are behind schedule.  There is no down time to play catch up.\n\n- Do the quizzes as early as you can.  You'll be too busy to be able to get too far ahead, but you can very easily fall behind.\n\n- Watch external videos on topics before watching the professor's lecture videos.  You'll have a less difficult time if you have a basic intuition of the subject before diving into the math which the professor loves to explain.\n\n- Visit office hours frequently in the early part of the week as it'll get more crowded on the weekends.\n\n- for any given assignment, you should be at least 70% done by the time you enter the final weekend before the deadline.  If not, you may find it tough to finish without burning late days.HelpfulHardNeutral15 hrs/wk", "Practical Statistical LearningFall 2021linkGood(ish)?5/13/2022, 9:53 AMNot sure what's the hype about this class.

I can say, that last year on AML in the old lectures professor constantly told that he will not explain anything about math and we need to suffer finding info ourselves. Here, the professor not only provided all the necessary links to understand the math behind each and every ML algorithm, but was ready to explain it in details in OH if not clear from the lectures, and also dedicated half of the coding assignment for the math formulas derivation.

I had never heard of Haskell, but it's a beautiful language and originally designed for CS research; the language has stuck around because it's great at what it was designed to do.\n\nImagining trying to write in a language with NO for loops or while loops -- you just have recursion. Learning to write in a \"functional language\" (look it up) will make you a better programmer and certainly understand recursion better.

The topics covered in the class are very interesting, ranging from different forms of evaluation, to parsing, to continuations and continuation passing style, to stack-based languages and (one way of) implementing objects.\n\nIn the class, we get to write the evaluation mechanisms for around 5 languages using Haskell, starting with a language with only arithmetic and logical operators and moving all the way to subsets of Scheme and Forth. \n\nNegatives: Professor Beckman seemed to have too much on his plate and either not enough help from TAs or not enough TAs for the size of the class.\n\nWhile the topics are interesting, they are probably not very relevant to a large fraction of programmers. Some parts of the course were very much Haskell-specific, e.g. monads, and the course has definite functional and theoretic slants. Implementing objects (as in OO programming) was covered, but from a theoretic functional (as in functional programming) perspective. Essentially no time was devoted to optimizations, compilers, or low-level concerns.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Programming Languages and CompilersSummer 2020linkMental summer sprint with oblivion11/15/2021, 12:57 PMThis course focuses on parsing and interpreting languages using a functional programming language (Haskell) including understanding syntax trees, grammar, regular languages, recursion, pipelining, lambda expressions, semantics, and more.  This course will cover how to interpret a language, not design a language.  You'll need to take a follow-up course if you want to learn how to design languages.  Most languages people use in popular programming (C, java, python, ...) are 'imperative' languages based on a state machine.   Each command or statement computes a result and updates the current state of the language during execution such as what's in memory, variables declared, values in caches, etc...  Haskell is a functional language where under the hood it's a giant graph of direct connections between inputs and outputs.   The main mechanism in functional programming is recursion and pipelining.  This course covers the use of these techniques to solve problems with minimal amount of code.\n\nThe course consists of:\n- weekly lecture (~30 minutes per week)\n- weekly quiz\n- 6 machine problems\n- 3 exams (2 midterm, 1 final)\n- course project or book report\n\nNOTE: The initial course schedule will stress you out if you study it too closely as you'll notice exams and assignment due dates collide everywhere.  Relax.  Professor Beckman is very lenient/easy and will adjust due dates as the course progresses, but often not until the last minute.  In the end everything will work out removing all collisions and other pain points.  However, as a summer course 15 weeks of content are crammed into 11 weeks of instruction.  It's important to hit the ground running as summer semester is a sprint.  There is no time to fall behind.  You've been warned.\n\nLecture material is quite terse.  Probably the shortest content of any course in the online MCS.  An average week consisted of 30 minutes of lecture material.  The lectures were very direct, to the point, and often required multiple viewings to make sure you gleaned every iota of information out of them.  Although they explain the concepts, they could use more examples and elaboration to get the point across.  Especially since there is no textbook for the course.  Most students spend a lot of time in office hours to get the details.\n\nQuizzes follow every lecture and are issued on PrairieLearn,  UIUC's own online testing site.  Questions and answers are rotated with each attempt, and some questions can be quite involved.  It may take several attempts before you see all the questions.  Some questions require you write Haskell code and can be quite involved (mentally).  If you're intent on scoring 100% on all the quizzes, then you might have a few long nights as some questions will require several attempts before you answer correctly.\n\nMachine problems are the heart and soul of the class.  You have one every two weeks with little or no down time in between.  Each machine problem is effectively a parser for a different language where a chunk of the parser has been provided and the student fills in the missing functions to complete the application.  Coding is done in text files and compiled using a Haskell compiler on the command line.  Autograders are provided to test code locally before submission for grading on Coursera.  The tasks and tests are quite comprehensive.  Some machine problems have more than 40 tests that must be successfully passed.  The machine problems can be quite difficult, and may require frequent visits to office hours.  Some TA's have been with the course for years and are really good about providing tips and tricks as long as you show good faith effort in trying to solve the problems before asking for help.\n\nOn the negative side - instructions are written with poor grammar leading to ambiguity and confusion.  If you cross out all instances of the heavily used words like \"actually\", \"itself\", \"back\", etc. then the instructions will start to look more like proper English and make more sense.  In essence, lots of redundancy...which is ironic considering this is a language course.\n\nThe amount of Haskell code written in this course will be very small.  That's largely because Haskell is designed to be compact and efficient relying on recursion as it's main mechanism of execution.  A quicksort algorithm in C or Java might take 50+ lines of code.  Haskell only requires 2!  The challenge on each assignment is to figure out how to write your code to use recursion to solve the problem instead of inline as you do in other languages.  The solution is always compact and elegant, so be mindful of how much code you're writing to solve a particular problem.  If it takes half the page, you're probably doing it wrong.\n\nOne big weakness of the course is the lack of textbook to learn Haskell.  The course insists on using a website called \"learn you a haskell good\" (or something like that), but just like it's title, it's written in slang that can be difficult to follow as the style is full of redundancy and idioms.  Although you'll only be using it for a few weeks, I suggest getting the book, \"Programming in Haskell\" by Graham Hutton.  It's very clearly written, easy to read, and you can slam through 8 chapters in a single day with clarity.  It does not cover all aspects of Haskell needed for the course, but it does cover the important language structures and syntaxes.  The rest is specific to CS 421 and won't be found in any textbook.\n\n'Activities' are optional sessions you can attend over zoom where the professor gives you a worksheet and you work in small groups for 10 minutes at a time to discuss and answer questions on the worksheet.  The class reconvenes and compares answers and go over the reasoning behind the concepts.  These can be useful, but in most cases the timing of the activities was out of touch with the class.  As in, they were offered and teaching an upcoming topic before the class was ready for them because they were still occupied with the previous assignment.  Had the professor waited a few more days, more students would've been available to benefit from the experience.\n\nExams were just like the quizzes.  Same style of questions, same level of difficulty.  However, some of the questions were a bit lengthier, and others required code be written.  There are 2 exams and a final exam.  Each exam covers half of the course and can be pretty tough.  Many students don't do so well.  however, the final exam is comprehensive and covers the same material.  If you do better on the final exam for a particular question than the same question on the midterm, then your score for both exams will be raised to that same level adjusting your grade for the better as it can only go up, not down.  This pulled many students out of C and B territory into A territory for the semester grade.\n\nThe final project is a choice between a written report/paper, or an implementation of an algorithm discussed in the course.  Most students chose the report because programming in Haskell on short notice when you're still new to the language could be challenging.  The report could be any topic on functional programming where you read an article or paper then summarize what you've read.\n\nProfessor Beckman is very lenient and mild mannered.  He's also a self proclaimed nerd to the Nth degree, pocket protector and all.  The good part is he's very knowledgeable about languages and programming them, and is willing to spend the time to explain whatever you want to know.  The downside is that he can be quite oblivious to what's going on around him, and that sometimes works against the situation such as the live activities he schedules out of tune with the direction the course is taking.  He's also rather oblivious to how scheduling can stress students out.   The initial schedule published in the course syllabus is full of conflicts which would stress out many students, but he doesn't correct the situation until the last minute.  You'd think after teaching the course for 20 years he'd put more attention into that detail in advance and put out a schedule that at least looks sensible.  There are other areas where this absent minded oblivion comes into play that students should be aware of before freaking out.\n\nkeys to success:\n\n- Do hit the ground running as summer courses are sprints with no down time.\n\n- Do assignments as early as possible. \n\n- Do visit office hours frequently.  You may need them to clarify information omitted or not well explained in the instructions. \n\n- Do seek out the longer tenured TA's as they'll be more willing to walk you through problem solving.  But be sure to show good faith effort before showing up and asking the question.\n\n- Do get the book by Graham Hutton and use it to learn the fundamentals of Haskell.\n\n- Do take quizzes as many times as you can to see all the questions and use them as study guides for the exams.\n\n- Do put extra emphasis on studying for the final exam as you'll be able to redeem yourself for prior mistakes.\n\n- Do not procrastinate.  There is no slack in the summer schedule to make up for lost time if you fall behind.HelpfulHardLiked30 hrs/wk", "Programming Languages and CompilersSummer 2021linkOnly tangentially useful, hard, interesting10/20/2021, 11:55 AMWould recommend? Yes, but only if there isn't another good class to take\nGrade: A\n\nThe good:\n- I am much, much more comfortable with recursion as a result of this class. Obviously, this is very useful.\n- The lectures are extremely concise and well delivered.\n- Challenging assignments drop you straight into implementation.\n- Open ended paper review/implementation project lets you explore whatever programming languages topic you want, so you're guaranteed something interesting--if you take the time to find something that resonates with you, of course.\n- Exposure to Haskell, which is a powerful if kind of esoteric language (from an industry perspective). If you're interested in quant finance, OCaml is similar and has some adoption there.\n- One of my favorite exam experiences ever; these were very fair evaluations. No trick or out of left field questions, great study materials (practice exams), and definitely not easy despite both of these.\n\nThe bad:\n- Class is misnamed: it's about interpreters, not compilers. Of course there's overlap, but still...\n- MPs escalate in difficulty to very hard. The main issue is that you're building pieces of pretty conceptually complicated software. The MP instructions are the length of full on papers, but yes, that still feels like not nearly enough. Office hours and tons of time reading campuswire were a must for me.\n- The course taught me the basic bits and pieces of language design and to making an interpreter, but didn't leave me feeling at all confident in bringing it all together on my own.\n- Practically speaking, this is a class to take for fun. Language design/implementation is a fairly small industry niche. If that's your space, great, but for most it's in the \"neat to know\" category.\n- On a similar note, the material itself is very academic. I had trouble linking many of the concepts to real applications.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the Haskell material early, before MP1.\n- Already said it, but will say it again: office hours are a must.\n- In my session, the lowest MP score was dropped. I strongly suggest saving this for the end, since the last two are very difficult.HelpfulHardLiked16 hrs/wk", "Programming Languages and CompilersSummer 2020linkBig step semantics oh-my9/3/2021, 1:23 PMThis course kicked my ass. A difficulty of very hard likely isn't true for most, but it is for me. I found the course conceptually very challenging and the sequencing often put difficult topics right on top of one another. For example continuation passing style transformations, were followed by monads, which were followed by parsing. The MPs while related, weren't timed such that they related directly to the content material. The final two MPs, implementing a scheme interpreter a type inferencer were hard enough I felt like an inadequate human being upon turning them in. I did get an A in the class.\n\nThe material is interesting and the professor and TAs were extremely available and helpful. Big step semantics were fun. Oddly, I love haskell coming out of this and feel deprived type system to lean. The lecture material each week is short but requires multiple rewatches. I greatly prefer this over very long lectures. This allowed me to watch snippets more easily throughout the week as I had time available.\n\nI would lower the difficult if MP5 and MP6 were excluded. I think stress from my other life responsibilities blended in to my overall interpretation (height of COVID).

I found many of the subjects fairly intriguing despite no prior background knowledge.\n\nCoursework:\n\nMost MPs are easy (1 or 2 were more difficult), first midterm is kinda hard and the final was easier, quizzes are a good way to consolidate learning from lectures.

While the subject matter is niche and may not be directly relevant to many software engineering roles, it offers valuable insights for those specifically interested in computer graphics.\n\nThe course mixed theoretical discussions with practical Python programming assignments using Jupyter notebooks. However, the terrain visualization assignment could've been clearer. The midterm exam was demanding, not only due to its tight time constraint but also the requirement to memorize numerous mathematical formulas and execute precise calculations rapidly. For those not venturing into graphics, investing time in memorizing these formulas may feel superfluous.\n\nThe instructors and TAs were notably proactive in addressing student queries. However, the professor occasionally seemed aloof, resorting to what felt like canned responses, which gave an impression of being somewhat detached from student concerns or nestled within an academic bubble.\n\nIn conclusion, while the course provides in-depth knowledge in its domain, its relevancy hinges largely on one's career trajectory in computer science.HelpfulHardDisliked6 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2023linkThink \"3D modeling\" not \"charts and graphs\"8/12/2023, 8:57 AMI took this course because it satisfies both an \"advanced\" and the \"graphics/hci\" breadth requirement. I went in thinking that we'd be learning details on the best practices on making charts and graphs, but that's not what it's about at all. Instead, it's more about:\n* choosing good color maps\n* interpolation\n* how to represent a 3d surface internally (spoiler: using a mesh of triangles)\n* how to represent lighting and shading on 3d object visuals\n* visualizing vector fields (think fluid dynamics and aerodynamics)\n* some stuff about tensors\n* drawing contour lines (think topological elevation maps).\n\nFor a non-DS track focused person, I liked this course a lot more than I would have expected.\n\nThe exams are HARD only because you only have an hour to do them and there are so many concepts to study. PRO TIP: write scripts for every concept you've learned (e.g., write a script to do linear and bilinear interpolation for you, which will save you A TON of time on the midterm). As a plus, these were unproctored exams (no ProctorU).\n\nThe MPs were easy, dare I say too easy -- primarily just implement-a-couple-functions-in-a-big-jupyter-notebook type of assignments.\n\nI wish there had been a final project, especially if we got to do it on a topic of our choosing, but that's not how it went.

If you like the area of computer graphics and prepare with other courses around this subject then you maybe able to benefit more.\n\nPros:\n- You can tick off both a 400 and 500 level requirement in one go if you pass.\n- Easy Quizzes and free marks as the answers are provided over unlimited attempts.\n- Well designed MPs which help you understand the concepts and good TAs (Summer '23) who help you debug your code.\n- Very approachable and active Prof. on Campuswire.\n- Open book non proctored exam. \n\nCons:\n- Exam 1 is too tough and was not needed to be that high difficulty level considering that the quizzes were made that easy. I would recommend having a more strict quiz with 3 attempts and a similar difficulty level exam.\n- No OH recordings and no Prof. OH either.\n- Some of the concepts are math heavy but it almost seems like the Prof. doesn't put into context the use case and real world usage of some of the things that are being taught which made it very vague for me.HelpfulMediumNeutral9 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2023linkExcellent, broad course with tricky exams8/6/2023, 3:01 PMHad Prof. Shaffer, who's extremely knowledgeable and heavily involved in the course - extremely refreshing for an online program.\n\nMaterial is broad and fast-paced, and while some topics aren't necessarily the most applicable to the average student, there are definitely topics that feel like a \"must know\" for anyone involved in computer graphics, graph theory, and visualizations (force-directed layouts, the general concept of interpolation for 2D and 3D visualizations, and \"marching squares/cubes\" for contour line rendering were especially interesting).\n\nGrading is very fair, but this isn't a guaranteed 'A' like many other classes in the program. 2/3 of the grade is easy to achieve 100% with enough effort - autograded quizzes and programming assignments. Exams, however, are tricky...especially the midterm. Median was a 70% plus a 10% curve up to 80. They're open book and unproctored, which is extremely nice (and lower stress than the typical ProctorU experience), but in return, you have to know the material thoroughly to complete in the one-hour block. Seemed like a fair trade-off for not having to put up with scheduled, proctored, logistically challenging ProctorU exams.\n\nWorkload is also very fair. Content is dense and I found that lectures took the most time to review and take notes, but MPs are comparatively light (3 of them took somewhere around 8-10 hours each, the other 3 are much lighter). \n\nDefinitely one of the better classes in the program; highly recommend for anyone in need of 500-level classes and even marginally interested in graphics & visualization. I'd recommend brushing up on basic calculus (including 2nd & 3rd order derivatives) as well as linear algebra (matrix multiplication and dot products/cross products), as some of the material becomes a bit math heavy if it's been a while since you've taken those classes.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2023linkDense content, great structure, math-heavy8/5/2023, 10:08 AMInstructor: Professor Eric Shaffer\n\nBackground:\n- 0 Years professional coding experience\n- Limited Python/NumPy exposure prior to course\n- Transitioning to tech from Structural Engineering\n- 1 of 3 courses taken this semester (full-time)\n- Didn't take recommended prereq's for this course\n\nSimilar to another review, I took this course for plan flexibility (fulfills both breadth & advanced requirements).\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed the structure and pace of the lectures. It did seem like it took half of the course (the first 6 weeks) for the pace/content to be adjusted for the 12-week semester format. Content remained 'locked' until roughly the beginning of the academic week each week which led to some disgruntled students who planned to work ahead and leave themselves a buffer for the summer.\n\nSupport:\nCampuswire posts were more helpful than my two other classes this semester. Students asked helpful questions, and the TA's responses were useful in debugging MP's. I did go to one TA office hour to get help for an MP. The help unblocked me, and cleared up some gaps in my understanding of the problem.\n\nHW/Quizzes:\nMP's & Quizzes via PrarieLearn. MP's were step-by-step with test cases after each chunk of code written to validate. Visible test cases were typically less thorough than what's necessary to submit and pass hidden (graded) test cases.\n\nQuizzes were pass/fail, with most concepts readily available in that week's lecture content.\n\nExams:\nI agree with other reviews, this was easily the toughest part of the course. The study topics provided to help prepare for each exam include practically every concept covered in that 6-week section. Familiarity with commonly used equations is necessary  to do well on exams. For some, this meant having Python scripts ready to speed calculation time. I regret not spending more time preparing such tools, as I know I missed some points from trivial calculator errors.\n\nConclusion:\nThis course was somewhat math-heavy. Nothing too intense, but lack of familiarity/time out of academia might make it necessary to spend time refreshing concepts to fully understand lecture material (i.e. Linear Algebra, Differential & Vector Calculus). I enjoyed the course and found it more interesting than I expected coming in.HelpfulHardStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2023linkBetter structured than most courses, hard exams8/5/2023, 2:43 AMInstructor: Shaffer, Eric\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is only relevant for the Summer 2023 iteration and may not hold for future iterations.\n\nTime Breakdown:\nTotal: 62.95 hr, Mean: 5.25 hr, Min: 3.2 hr, Max: 10.02 hr, SD: 2.04 hr\n\nBackground:\n- 5th course in the MCS program\n- Only course this term\n- No prior knowledge of the subject (prerequisites are not enforced)\n- Full time Software engineer (> 5 YoE)\n- Employer covering tuition\n\nI took this course to give my plan flexibility as it can be used for both the breadth and advanced requirements, and less so for its topic.\n\nGrade Breakdown:\n- 12% Quiz (1% x 12)\n- 54% Homework (9% x 6)\n- 34% Exam (17% x 2)\n\nMaterial:\nThe course focuses on the techniques of visualizing scientific data, and not at all the typical data that data scientists would work on like sales data, etc. Scientific data includes isosurfaces (from e.g. volumetric data), polygonal meshes, scalar/vector/tensor fields, and graphs. Thus this course is quite niche and has not much similarity with the other data visualization courses.\n\nI do not see a use for it in my work but I would still say the material is interesting on its own.\n\nLectures:\nAll lectures are given by Shaffer. The slides are not bad and make for good \"presentations\" because they are not super text heavy and have illustrations. At the same time, this is also their weakness. Because there is not much text, the slides are not very useful on their own and you basically have to watch the lectures to make sense of the slides.\n\nThere is no textbook for this course, so it was a bit tough for me because I like to read the textbook ahead of watching lectures. In the end, I don't think it made too much difference because it was sufficient for me to download and annotate the slides while watching the lectures.\n\nThere is typically 1-2 hours of lecture each week. It usually takes me double the time to complete the lectures (at 1x speed) as I spend time writing down notes.\n\nShaffer does provide references to some papers, many of which are approachable. But I hardly read any of these papers outside of those directly critical for the week's material.\n\nSupport:\nCampuswire is used, and Shaffer responds to questions -- higher than average (a low bar), but less than PSL's Liang). TAs are also responsive.\n\nNo comment on office hours as I did not attend any. Only the TAs have office hours; Shaffer does not hold any.\n\nQuizzes:\nThe quizzes (and homework) are served on a separate website called PrairieLearn. All quizzes were due at the end of the term.\n\nUnlimited attempts, and some questions change after each attempt. 80% is passing but you should really be able to get 100% with unlimited attempts.\n\nHomework:\nThe HWs are done solo. They are in Python and you work in Jupyter notebooks in PrairieLearn. Typically given 2 weeks to complete. But deadlines had been extended this term so it never felt like there were too many things due at the same time.\n\nThe assignments are filling in skeleton code. But not too bad or trivial. The provided test cases are typically insufficient to pass the autograder which runs hidden test cases. Sometimes it is a combination of understanding the underlying concept well as well as debugging the problem statement. That is, sometimes need to go to office hours / ask questions on Campuswire. I was able to figure out things just by reading Campuswire posts from students with better time management than I.\n\nLike quizzes, HW have unlimited attempts.\n\nI think that there were too few assignments for the amount of material the course covered and it would be nice to have more.\n\nExams:\nThe hardest part of the course. But also not bad in their own way - they are open book and none of that ProctorU nonsense. You take them on PrairieLearn at any time of your choosing within the given one week window. Most importantly, you have only one hour.\n\nI think the exam setup is quite fair (outside of the time limit):\n- Quizzes are good preparation.\n- Shaffer provided a study guide of important topics. Study them and you are at least 80% of the way there.\n- Some questions (particularly computation ones) allow for a second attempt (for fewer points).\n\nThe hard part is the one hour time limit as there are some computation questions that can eat up time. So practice these calculations beforehand and have a physical calculator on hand. If you can blitz through a good chunk of questions unaided, you will have time to check notes.\n\nThe exams were curved this term, if that is some comfort.\n\nConclusion:\nVery niche class and not having too much relation / follow up with the other graphics courses. Despite having no prior knowledge, the material is still presented clear enough for me to follow.\n\nAlso, just be aware the course is similar to the other courses in the program in the \"mile wide, inch deep\" coverage of the topics.HelpfulMediumLiked6 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2023linkDense subject matter with surface level understanding.8/1/2023, 12:16 PMOverall:\nThis course is reasonably well-structured. There are weekly quizzes that have difficult questions, then these questions tend to be mostly recycled in one form or another for the exams. Then there are several programming assignments which vary wildly in difficulty. The subject material is so dense, with so much research, that they can't possibly cover it all, and so as a result you end up getting only surface exposure to many, many concepts. \n\nQuizzes: \nEach question can individually be taken as many times as you'd like, so you'll almost certainly get 100 points on every quiz. They are collectively worth 12% of your final grade (1% each) so don't miss the free points. They are also the basis for the exams so make sure you understand them well.\n\nExams:\nThis is the most controversial topic in the class. Each exam (midterm and final) is worth 17% of your final grade, and only ONE HOUR is given for each. There are way too many questions and way too many calculations for this timing to be reasonable, and the teachers and TAs say not to worry about it. They do curve the exam depending on overall class performance but it's needlessly stressful.\n\nMPs: \nIn my semester there were 6 MPs. The second one and the fifth one were more difficult but I didn't think any of them were particularly difficult. You can also submit these as many times as you'd like. I have found that the issue across all UIUC courses that give you these MPs in Jupyter notebooks is that they do all the \"science\" for you, and you're left fighting with pandas or sci-kit or loops or something, and guessing what the auto-grader is expecting.

The course is exposure level on a lot of topics. It will get deep on only 3-4 topics based on the HW assignments.\n\n2. Prepare a separate notebook while doing the Quizzes and HWs as the exams are open book, but you may not have access to them during the exam.\n\n3. Plan how to approach the multiple attempt Exam questions, you may get more points if consider multiple answers for a question that allows multiple attempts.\n\n4. The exams are mostly like the quizzes and HWs, but there are curveball questions that you cannot really prepare for without a deeper understanding of the material. It's impossible to guess those, but you can still get an 'A' even if you don't get those correct, so don't stress.\n\n5.

Lectures are very information dense, and can get rather boring at times. \n\nAssignments are easy and don't take more than a couple hours to complete each. Exams are straightforward too, but covers a lot of content. Professor and staff are helpful and understanding. \n\nThe course content itself doesn't feel very practically useful unless you are considering visualization as a space. Even then, it is more of a sampler/intro class, so don't expect to build a deep understanding of anything.HelpfulVery EasyDisliked3 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2022linkFun course for those interested in scientific data8/7/2022, 2:16 PMThis course teaches you a rough overview of common computer graphics techniques (e.g. Phong shading, 3D meshes and operations on them, ...) with a strong emphasis on visualizing volume data (scalar fields), vector field data (e.g. fluid flow, weather, etc), network data & trees. You also learn things which are pretty generally applicable as (pseudo-random) sampling techniques, some numerical computing as Euler's method, Runge-Kutta and graphics techniques as mesh simplification, marching cubes, rendering etc. What it is NOT: Best of Edward Tufte or the like. \n\nPRO:\n* Very engaged professor who showed up daily on Campuswire (including weekends) and really cares for you to understand the material\n* Very engaged TAs who have been nice, and genuinely helpful.\n* I had a nice class with many good contributions, too. \n* High quality lectures which are well presented. \n\nCON:\n* Some homework assignments were made available pretty late (transitioning to Prairielearn took time). So, one of the assignments had to be skipped, but it was replaced by an extra credit opportunity. On the flip side: staff found a student-friendly solution to all issues which arose. \n*  I wish there had been a final project as half of the homeworks were trivially easy. The others took more time, but only because I was at times struggling with the autograder, but still there was lots of boiler plate, so I don't really have a great sense of achievement. And nothing to show off on GitHub (granted, I have the rest of my life left to do that...). \n\nGENERAL:\n* Exams are open-book, but mind you: You better be prepared, because the time limit is tough. For most of the class the mid-terms couldn't be finished on time (thus many did mediocre). Final (non-cumulative) exam was much easier. Generally, the exams are very fair and you get good instructions as to how to prepare. IMHO open-book with time limit is much better than proctored, because so much more flexible in scheduling and no proctoring hassle. \n* Math: I am kind of a life science renegade (with a PhD in computational biology and several years of experience in Python, ML, DL) and had no issues with it. You'll apply some linear algebra, some calculus and some numerical equation solving (and are taught all you need in class). \n* Some literature references were made and partially assigned as homework. I enjoyed those. \n\nVERDICT:\n* A fun course if you are interested in graphics, science and data (visualization) with great staff and very fair conditions.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked13 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2022linkReally enjoyed the course8/6/2022, 10:56 AMI doubted between this course and Data Visualization, but after reading the Data Vis reviews mentioning that it was a very easy course, I decided to go for this course to do something more challenging, am really happy that I did.\n\nThe topics are really interesting, and despite other reviews mentioning that they might not have a lot of practical relevance for most jobs, I do believe I learned a lot that I might someway or the other use later, and if not than at least it taught me extra (critical) thinking skills. The lectures explain really well. The quizes are a good indication for what to expect on the exam (open book), but the exam is timed, so you need to prepare well if you want to finish all questions before the exam finishes. There were 6 MPs (one of which was bonus) and they are fun to do. They require you to fill in a notebook, but the instructions are very clear, and provide all the details you need in order to complete them.

Yet, the first few weeks go over and explain all the required background you need to know. So do not worry too much about prereqs. Knowledge of basic calculus (differentiation) and some linear algebra might be good to have though.HelpfulMediumStrongly Liked10 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationSummer 2022linkFun and Engaging Scientific Visualization Course8/6/2022, 8:56 AMI took this course over the Summer semester of 2022 because I was interested in the material and interested in computer graphics in general. This semester was different from the previous semesters since we did not have a final project. Instead, we were assigned a total of six programming assignments throughout the course that covered the topics discussed in the course.\n\nI had previously taken 418 since it was a suggested requirement but honestly, in my opinion, the lectures in this course do a great job and cover the essentials to understand computer graphics to the point where anyone new to graphics can do well.\n\nThe course had a total of six assignments, two exams, and weekly quizzes. The weekly quizzes had unlimited submissions and turned out to be a great tool for studying. Of the six assignments, only 5 were required to complete since the instructor made the last homework assignment extra credit due to time constraints. All of the assignments were Jupyter Notebooks and at times they were difficult. Going to office hours and looking at Campuswire discussions made it easier to complete. I found the assignments to be rewarding and really helpful since they covered the algorithms and techniques discussed in lectures. Being able to actually create the visualizations talked about in the lecture was fun.\n\nThe exams were single attempt, timed, and not proctored. We were allowed to use any resource to complete the exam except for collaboration, obviously. The exams could be completed effortlessly with enough preparation but can be difficult if you wait until the last minute to study.\n\nThe teaching staff and the instructor really cared about the topic and the students. They would do their best to help out and were always easy to get a hold of.

I didn't take 418 and had no trouble personally with the material.\n\nThe assignments are all Jupyter notebooks where you are required to fill in sections of code. They can be difficult and time intensive, especially the later ones.\n\nTruth be told, this class is not very practical for 99% of people and is only really relevant for someone working in niche scientific applications.

An excellent class.\n\nThe MPs are in browser notebooks, but this doesn't detract from the course. The implementation details are still on you, including edge cases in the algorithms. There was only on MP that felt too easy, and none that felt too difficult.\n\nThe final project is worth the same credit as one MP, and will give you back exactly what you put in when it comes to learning. Totally open ended, and can be done either on your own or in a group.\n\nComing in without significant graphics exposure, I did not feel that the class was too difficult. It does help to be familiar with mathematical notation and statistical concepts like distributions, but there was nothing here students couldn't pick up on the fly. That said, participating in class discussion on CampusWire was essential to learning implementation details that weren't made obvious in lecture. This was made especially apparent in the quizzes.\n\nWeekly quizzes had unlimited attempts and were a fantastic way to learn. Many questions focused on working through algorithms from lectures by hand, ensuring that you didn't merely get the concepts, but could actually use them.\n\nThe exams were difficult, but very fair. The format was unproctored and you could use any physical or digital resources you prepared in advance or could look up.

The class is organized well with weekly quizzes and the python programming assignments that are easy in the beginning but increases in difficulty later. Final project of choice can be done individually or in a group on any visualization related topic. The material was interesting for someone coming in with 0 knowledge of computer graphics and didn't know what to expect. Knowledge of basic calculus and ordinary differential equations is required.\n\nThe mid term was difficult for the extremely little time given to complete it - it felt almost unfair. If you cannot solve the calculation problems in the quizzes lightning fast in your sleep, you'll be in for a rough time as the exam problems are harder.

This is NOT a data science course.  The course, according to professor Shaffer, is not intended to be programming heavy, but instead focus on the math and discussion of visualization.\n\nCS 418 Interactive Computer Graphics is the pre-requisite.  Although CS 416 Data Visualization is also accepted as a pre-requisite, it will not properly prepare you for the course.  You can still pass the course and earn an \"A\" without CS 418, but the road to get there will be a lot tougher if you don't have any prior computer graphics experience.\n\nThe course consists of:\n- weekly video lecture\n- weekly quiz\n- 4 machine problems \n- 2 programming assignments (larger MPs) \n- course project\n- 2 exams (midterm and final)\n\nThe lectures are fairly thorough accounting for at least 60 minutes of material per week.  The material is engaging, but can also go into the weeds on a few subjects.  There is a lot of detail to remember for equations and formulas.  Note taking or frequent viewing will be required.  Much of the early course material is a repeat from CS 418.  Early half of the course focuses on 2D image and 3D linear methods that can be computed with simple ratios, arithmetic and so on.  The 2nd half of the course changes gears and dives into calculus and differential equations such as with Principal Component Analysis.  The last week or two of the course covers graphs using Forced Directed layouts and other tree structures.  As a ratio, about 60% of the course covers topics in 3D, 30% in 2D and the last 10% in graphs/charts.\n\nThe machine problems are fairly short compared to other courses in the online MCS program.  Most can be completed within a few hours or a day.  Students coming into the course without CS 418 or prior computer graphics experience tended to struggle and spend a LOT longer - such as days.   Assignments are programmed in Jupyter notebooks using the Python programming language.  Different libraries are used for each assignment including numpy, PyVista, SciKit-Learn, Seaborn, Pytorch, and more.  You implement algorithms discussed in a given week. In many cases the heavy lifting is already done and the student merely fills in the blanks to complete the work and enjoy the rewards.  A few assignments, however, were not well explained and confused even the more experienced students.  PyVista is used for many assignments, which is a geometry library with plotting capabilities.  Not the most intuitive library, but is designed for efficiency of large data sets.  Overall expect to spend a lot of time reading about and learning new APIs as nearly every machine problem uses a different set of libraries.\n\nProgramming assignments were effectively larger machine problems.  They were not any more difficult, just more work to do.\n\nQuizzes are issued every week and quite comprehensive.  Some quizzes have many questions, others only a few.  Quizzes are issued on PrairieLearn, and both questions and answers rotate with each attempt.  You may need to take the quiz several times before you see all the variations.  Most questions involve computation or reasoning.  In the case of calculus and differential equations, the math problems chosen for the questions are rather vanilla in complexity, but you still need to know the concept to solve them (partial derivatives, gradient, curl, runge-kutta, newton's method, stoke's theorem, ...).  quizzes weren't due until the end of the course, so no rush to do them right away.  However it was usually best to take them immediately upon finishing the lectures.\n\nExams - ah, this is the big gotcha you have to pay attention to.  The questions are not any more difficult than those found in the quizzes, but the exam is only 50 minutes long.  Sounds like plenty, but that includes time to read the question and do the math.  In essence, you need to know the material well enough to have the answer on the tip of your tongue and ready to write it down as a knee-jerk reaction.  If you have to check your notes or derive the equation, you'll fail.  Almost everybody in the class failed to finish on time, and the scores reflected that.  The exam was not proctored by ProctorU, but instead monitored by PrairieLearn.  Notes were allowed, but as I stated earlier, if you needed them, you wouldn't finish on time.\n\nThe final project is essentially an open project of your choosing, and isn't particularly strict about it's parameters.  It does not have to be a programming assignment, but could be a video, tutorial, essay, or other format as long as it required an adequate amount of time to research and prepare.  the final report needed to be a 2-column format used in white papers.  I chose a programming assignment to further investigate algorithms covered in the course, but other students chose book reports and the like.\n\nSuggested reading:\n\n\"Practical Linear Algebra: A Geometry Toolbox\", by Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford.  This is a supplement to a course in linear algebra and focuses on fundamental algorithms in 2D and 3D computer graphics.  Can be downloaded for free as a PDF through the UIUC library.\n\n\nKeys to success:\n\n- Do take CS 418 as pre-requisite or find equivalent knowledge elsewhere.\n\n- Do watch the lecture videos multiple times to absorb the material.  There's a lot packed into them.\n\n- Do take quizzes immediately after watching the lecture videos.  Retake quizzes to get exposure to more questions and variety of questions.\n\n- Do study the quizzes intensely, and practice them too, as preparation for the exams.  Prioritize exams over all else when the time comes.\n\n- Do ask for examples of code demonstrating algorithms that are not provided in the lectures or machine problems.  For example, radial basis functions.  You may see them on the exam.\n\n- Do not memorize or cram at the last minute for the exams.  There is too much material to cover.  You need to understand process and procedure to reason things out.HelpfulMediumLiked10 hrs/wk", "Scientific VisualizationFall 2020linkTake CS 418 Interactive Computer Graphics First8/8/2021, 4:01 PMI took this the first time the class was publicly offered, in Fall 2020.

The root of the bad reviews seemed to be the course project.  However, the course project this semester was heavily revamped this year for the better.  That made this course a pretty solid one. Lectures were good, with a live session on Friday's.  MPs were reasonable and a good learning experience.  Overall, I would take this class again.  I think this is great for those that have never taken a similar course to this.  For someone like myself who has an Analytics background, this was a great course. but I could see this being boring for someone who had an undergrad degree in computer science or for someone who has already been in the field. This course isn't a must take quite yet, but I think it's a solid option. I am giving this score a \"strongly liked\" to help the average but I still think this class is about a 4/5 which is good.\n\n\nCourse Project:\nFor the term project we were assigned to teams of 8 with a prebuilt base of an application and we hade 5 different milestones with different things to complete in two week increments.  Each team was assigned a specific TA to ask questions to throughout the semester.  This allowed us to receive very quick answers to questions and each milestone was graded within 5 days.   This structure was great and I recommend other courses do something similar.\n\nWhat wasn't great was that with team sizes of 8 (randomly assigned), it allowed many team members to hide and not have to do any work.  I had 3 team members submit 0 commits on the project.  This turned a project that should only take up 1-3 hours per week per person to a project that took a few of us on the team 5-10 hours per week.  If you get a good team this project should be a great experience and if you don't this will turn into a much harder course.\n\n\nMPs:\nBesides the term project, the MPs were interesting and very doable.  I completed each of them in less than 4-5 hours each.  They all built off of each other and aligned well with what was being taught. I never had worked with Java before this course but was able to do this pretty easily. TAs were helpful if you had any questions.  Only thing I didn't like is that there wasn't an autograder set up that allowed multiple submissions like other courses.  This means you only got one submission and even if you pass the tests locally, it does not mean that it will work when you turn it in due to environment changes.  This caused me to get low scores initially on a couple of the MPs but I was able to resubmit and get much of my points back the second time around.  I hope they add actual autograders in the future with more than one submission. But I understand as these MPs were brand new this semester.\n\nQuizes:\nPretty easy. Multiple choice and from the lecture.  Very easy points.\n\nExam:\nFinal was a mix of questions worded just like the quizzes and some coding questions that were much harder.  I wish there was a better way to prepare for those coding questions because I would have likely done much better but overall the exam was pretty fair.\n\nBook Report:\nIf you are taking the 4 credit hour class you will have to do a book review.  You get to choose a software engineering course from a pre-selected list.  These topics range from Agile to Clean Code. I enjoyed reading my book and thought it was a good learning experience.  I would have not read this if not for this assignment and I am glad I did.  The guidelines for the book report was simple, 5-10 pages, single spaced, and you needed highlighted sections for each chapter.  One section for the Summary.  One section for how you can relate to this chapter with your Experience.  The only rubric for this was to follow the description above and as long as you talk about your own personal experience and can portray that you understand the content with your personal experience than you would get the full amount of points. I wish there was a set rubric for this but overall this was a solid assignment.\n\nBonus Points:  We were awarded 5% bonus points if you participated on Campuswire throughout the semester.  There was a points threshold that you had to hit.  Pretty easy to get your points here.\n\nAlso, in the course project.  If you missed points early on because a feature wasn't implemented properly or you missed it entirely.  You could go back and fix it at the end and get half of your missed points back.

I waited until finishing another semester before reviewing the course to calibrate whether other classes suffered from similar issues. I would NOT recommend this course if you 1) are in a busy season at work or life, 2) need to be able to plan your semester based on deadlines in the syllabus, or 3) are just starting the program.\n\nThe good:\n1. As a person who learned programming first through statistical programming, I found the lectures and MPs very helpful to improve meta programming practices (design patterns, clean code/code smells, agile vs waterfall, etc.). Unlike other courses, I found the MPs were very well designed to reinforce concepts in the lecture and provide concrete lessons that could apply to my day to day.\n2. The week to week workload was not too much throughout the semester. At the end of the semester, this changed due to the final group project.\n\nThe bad:\n1. There was a single spaced 10 page book report due at the end of the semester. While I ended up appreciating the technical book that I selected, the essay generated a huge administrative burden for TA's to grade meaning we got less meaningful feedback on the final project [more on that later].\n2. In Fall '22 the course was taught by 2 new professors. I think it was due to inexperience, but they pushed back deadlines of MPs and milestones frequently. While this benefits students since there were questions on milestones for the group project, I found this practice penalized the students who worked ahead. We would receive clearer requirements along with an extension, but this resulted in re-working the artifacts that we had already prepared.\n\nThe ugly:\n1. The group project for this class was an interesting idea at face value: contribute to an open source project with points based on coding, documentation, and extra credit if your PR is accepted. However, the implementation of the administration of the project was incredibly frustrating. Resources and details on requirements were located on three different sites (CampusWire, Wiki, and Coursera) with conflicting information. In the weeks before the final project was due, we received word that the midterm checkpoint would no longer be graded. This was incredibly frustrating as my group had pushed hard to stick to our schedule, produce a polished mid-point deliverable, and stay on pace. The final project grading left many frustrated and confused because the requirements incentivized providing details and explaining the implementation, but the TA:student ratio resulted in TA's needing to grade the final project, essay, and help students study for the final while they were still dealing with their own work.HelpfulEasyDisliked5 hrs/wk", "Software Engineering IFall 2021linkDecent introduction to software engineering1/18/2022, 5:21 PMThe course was straightforward and a nice balance of lectures with machine problems. It was also the first semester for the two instructors who inherited the course and had to keep core content stable (unchanged). Overall, I think if you come from a software engineering (or even CS) background, you won't learn much. But for those looking for an introduction into the world of software engineering, this course will be more useful.\n\nThe course is made up of lectures, weekly quizzes, 5 machine problems, 10-page book report, and group term project. Although the workload was reasonable, there was quite a few items to track and this led to some ambiguity, especially for the term project. However, I felt that all this was reasonable and actually adds to the \"real-world\" simulation for software engineering, where you'd be expected to operate at high levels of uncertainty. The final exam and quizzes were multiple choice and pretty straightforward. Many folks disliked the book report due to its very specific length and content requirements, but I quite enjoyed it for incentivizing me to read a CS-related book I otherwise may not have read. As for the term project, it was the first semester they tried a new format, which was to work in a group to contribute to open source software projects. I do think the execution of the project needs some work (a lot of extra admin type work to prepare deliverables), but overall I enjoyed the real-world experience that made this course pretty unique.

Pick a book from the list which relates to your work! I picked the devops one and it was a great read.\n\nThe group project is a disaster. You pick some open source java projects on github and fix the issues or address feature requests. The criteria was changed a few times and it was not flexible. We had to beg the TAs to let us choose new projects and issues when we found out the original ones doesn't work out. We did however provided many suggestions to the teaching staffs about those projects in campuswire and those should be sorted out in the next few iterations as well. In addition, you don't get to pick your teammates and also have timezone issues, although the teaching staffs mentioned that they would consider timezone issues for future iterations.\n\nThe video lectures do not reflect the latest industry standards. Some of the design patterns taught are not used in the industry anymore.

The average of this class is an A according to the professor, and you were given a final score to sort out any potential issues with grading which is kind of nice for that by having good transparencies! \n\nThe final project grade and book report grade did not have any comments, but the gradings were also pretty lenient as well! And some of the teams asked for clarifications for final project grading and the TA actually responded as well. But comments should be given to us automatically instead of us asking!\n\nI know a lot of people actually hated this course, and I actually hated at the beginning. But you will learn something if you take time to complete the MPs, and pick a good book to read for the book report. \nI just wished there are more MPs, and that the group project could be more polished.\n\nOne good thing is that both professors are actively engaged in campuswire. This is one of the few rare gifts for the MCS programs to have professors actively engaged with students. Many other classes were run by TAs and I actually appreciate the fact that professors themselves run the class!\n\nIn general, if you can wait, maybe see the next iteration and see if the situation improves.HelpfulMediumNeutral15 hrs/wk", "Software Engineering IFall 2021linkNot relevant to real software engineering and not taught well12/23/2021, 1:54 PMMultiple students were planning to file formal complaints about the class. Course was in extreme disrepair, both in terms of material and administration.\n\nAdmin stuff: Very very mismanaged class. Grading standards were constantly changing and unclear, and announcements were scattered across many platforms. Students who put effort into tracking the fine print mostly got A's. Students who found this more difficult ended up with lackluster grades because they got lost in requirements. Last I heard, multiple students were planning on filing formal complaints.\n\nLectures and assessments: Extremely dry and very formalized. Lots of emphasis on vocab that predominantly isn't actually used in modern software engineering.\n\nProject: This is the lion's share of the grade, and this semester was shaken with a brand new format. The idea was to contribute to open source, restricted mostly to having to write code (no documentation contributions) and having to do so in java. Though a good goal on paper, the project execution fell flat. Folks who were familiar with jumping into new production code did fine, while the rest floundered with no real guidance.\n\nHomework (MPs): Old toy code once upon a time written by students. Does not help bridge to production code, but does make an ok-ish intro to basic java. Assignments are to fix bugs in these projects, add a feature, etc. The tooling and libraries used are remarkably stale; one MP even pointed students to an archived external page for instructions.\n\nBook report: Best part of the class, provided you pick a good book. Unfortunately, this is effectively not part of the class but entirely self-study. Report itself is graded, but comes with no feedback unless you actively chase it.\n\nMy opinion: If you want to learn, skip this one. If you want an easy but incredibly frustrating A, this one might be for you.HelpfulEasyStrongly Disliked10 hrs/wk", "Software Engineering IFall 2021linkSoftware engineering is busy work12/23/2021, 10:23 AMThe content itself is not difficult. Handling this class with another class I can say I underestimated the workload.

However, a lot of content in this course are absolutely outdated, especially the software used for the assignment. It appears to me that the new team of instructors does not bother to update the content at all. I also think the book report shouldn't be counted for 25% of your total grade.HelpfulMediumDisliked15 hrs/wk", "Software Engineering IFall 2021linkCourse in serious disrepair11/17/2021, 3:59 PMSoftware Engineering I is a course about the fundamentals of developing and maintaining software as part of a team.  Topics include: history of software development, programming vs. software engineering, designing software, design patterns, compilation, testing, debugging, code smells, release and maintenance.  Time investment isn't too bad at less than 10 hours per week.  Difficulty level is low making this suited more for undergraduates new to the subject.  The main reason to take this course is to be familiar with the role of software engineer in application development.\n\nThe regular instructor for the course was on sabbatical this semester, so in his place the course was taught by 2 co-instructors as substitutes.  On the first day of class, the lead co-instructor said they intended to keep everything exactly the same as previous semesters down to every last detail.   Well, that turned out to be a very big and naive mistake as the regular instructor let the course fall into disrepair while the co-instructors assumed everything was current and maintained.  The reality was that software for assignments was obsolete, instructions referred to techniques which are no longer practiced, and every assignment had to be overhauled to be functional.  This made for a very bumpy ride for students as nothing seemed to work out of the box.  As a result, just about every assignment for the course was compromised in some way, either by extending the due dates, relaxing requirements, or making them optional towards grading.\n\nThe course consists of lecture videos, weekly quizzes, 5 machine problems, a course project (team effort), book report, and final exam.  All of the quizzes and machine problems are available on the first day of class allowing students to work ahead if they so choose.  However, the course project must be done as scheduled because it's part of a team effort, and the final exam is only available in the final week of the course.\n\nThe lecture videos provide a general overview of the software industry including history of software development, how it has evolved from the early days, and the difference between working as a programmer vs. as an engineer as part of a team.  The videos are 8-15 minutes apiece across 8-10 videos for approximately 90 minutes of material per week.  The lectures are easy to follow and don't involve any hardcore proofs or math.  However, the lectures only cover the first 11 weeks of the course.  Each lecture video is followed up with a practice quiz (not graded), and a weekly quiz (graded).  Quizzes are multiple choice, and not too difficult.  Even if you're new to software engineering, you can accurately guess the answers to most questions as they're fairly common sense for most lectures.  Most quizzes have unlimited attempts, but may cap the number of attempts per day.  The exception is the first two quizzes where you only get 2 attempts total.\n\nMachine problems are pretty basic and cover topics in web development, design patterns, debugging, testing, and code smells.  In each assignment some of the project is already provided, and the student merely has to fill in the blanks.  The assignments are not terribly challenging and do not take much time compared to other courses.  On the down side, most of the assignments are grossly out of date using software which has long been discontinued.  In fact, the first assignment was so old and obsolete that students had to use the internet archive time machine just to get the instructions to do the assignment.  Yeah, that bad.  Modern operating systems, such as Ubuntu Linux, could not download and install the required components either because they were beyond obsolete and perceived as a safety risk.  Fortunately, newer versions were backward compatible to allow the assignments to be completed without major problems.  The machine problems cover topics of: java web development, design patterns, testing, debugging, and code smells (writing clean code).  Average time spent on a machine problem is 5-10 hours.  The first assignment must be completed no a virtual machine of a specific environment so as to make grading consistent.  All other assignments are downloaded from Coursera and can be completed on any operating system.  Assignments are graded with autograders provided on the coursera server.\n\nThe big kahuna for this course is the course project.  Students are assigned groups and must work together to fix bugs and/or implement new features in public projects on GitHub.  Teams must curate projects that satisfy requirements provided by the instructors, and find tasks that require at least 6 weeks of cumulative work across as many issues as necessary.  Teams are graded on the ability to schedule, solve, and complete tasks and have them accepted by the project owners as a pull request/code merge.  Bonus points if your task is merged into the code base.\n\nThe challenge is finding suitable Github projects to work on.  Many code bases are either very large and difficult to work with requiring deep domain knowledge before you can meaningfully contribute, or projects that are too small/old and in disrepair.  You will spend a LOT of time searching for suitable projects.  The instructors had to relax requirements because teams could not find enough projects meeting the requirements.  The other challenge is getting all teammates to work together to agree on which projects to work on, and which issues satisfy course requirements.  Each team member is graded as part of a group.  Therefore, there's a lot of peer pressure to contribute so as not to drag everybody else down.  Each task requires reporting to prove the work has been done including Unit tests, demonstration, static analysis, and more.  Another challenge is getting all team members to keep the team report up to date.  If teams are working together on the same project, sharing issues could be a problem.\n\nGraduate students must complete a book report as the 4th credit hour requirement.  The report represents 25% of the course grade, and must be from a book in an approved list.  Students may suggest a book, but must submit to instructors for review early in the course to be considered.  The book report is essentially a summary of the book, chapter by chapter, and must include the student's educational or professional experience in the subject.\n\nThe final exam is all multiple choice to represent the style of questions / format presented in the quizzes.\n\nIn summary, this course is designed for undergraduates and not terribly challenging, but needed if you plan on working in a software development role as there are certain concepts and responsibilities you just need to know before you'll be taken seriously in a job interview.  This course provides the foundational elements.  The more advanced stuff comes in later courses.  The co-instructors did try to update the course through the use of weekly live lectures in their respective office hours.  Some of the lectures included outside participants such as panels from industry, bleeding edge research in compiler construction, or automatic patching/bug fixing.\n\nKeys to success:\n\n- watch lectures and do quizzes as early as you can.\n\n- do the practice quizzes after each lecture video.\n\n- do machine problems early as many of them have quality control problems that may require adjustments, but also to avoid schedule conflicts with the course project.\n\n- do invest time curating Github projects for the course project.  Once the choices are made, you are not allowed to change them, for better or for worse.  so pick wisely.\n\n- Be emphatic about the nuanced details of the course project with your team mates.  It's very easy to let the ball drop in the middle, and everybody's grade suffers if that happens.HelpfulEasyNeutral7 hrs/wk"]}

However, the most annoying part is the untransparent way of marking; for example, I got a lower mark for the final project although I had an equivalent role to my colleagues in the same project. I tried to reach the prof. Zhai in every way possible to get clarification of the reason for giving me low marks and marking some of my reports undelivered although it was marked delivered for my colleagues in the same report. he did not respond in any way, not in the forum, not through the direct email or the university admin email who confirmed the query transferred to the prof.HelpfulHardDisliked6 hrs/wk", "Text Information SystemsFall 2023linkDisorganized and disappointing1/2/2024, 8:19 AMOVERVIEW\n\nThis course gives an overview of information retrieval and some natural language processing techniques.\n\nIt consists of lectures, homework assignments (MPs), two non-cumulative exams, a final project, and a technology review paper if you're taking the course for 4 credit hours. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nB.S. in Economics & Minor in CS\n30 hr/week data science internship\nFirst semester in the program\n\nOVERALL \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThis course's quality was completely undermined by awful management by the course staff and professor; a combination of boring lectures, pointless assignments, and inconsistent exam difficulty made this course the worst I've taken in the program thus far. The only saving grace is the final project, which can be a great opportunity if taken seriously. But overall, I cannot recommend this course and hope that significant changes are made for future students. \n\nLECTURES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nThe lectures were okay. Most of them were boring and felt somewhat outdated but the concepts are communicated fairly clearly. \n\nHOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThe homework assignments felt pointless. On one hand, they're very easy to cheese in order to get 100%, but on the other hand they don't really help you learn anything at all. Some of the assignments were literally just changing the parameters for ranking algorithms that could be done with only a few lines of code. Also, needlessly complex submission methodology at times outweighed the actual work required for the assignment, which made the setup/submission an absolute chore and complete waste of time. \n\nEXAMS \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThe exams were fine. Confusingly, I felt that the first exam was significantly more difficult than the second. The former was much more conceptual whereas the latter was graded based on how well you memorized the quiz questions. In terms of studying, if you drill the questions from all the quizzes you should be okay on both of them, but just know that the first exam seemingly covers much more material in a more conceptual way. The exams are also done through ProctorU, which automatically means this aspect of the course is undermined significantly. \n\nFINAL PROJECT \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThe final project is open-ended, meaning that you can pretty much get away with building whatever you want provided it relates to the content from the course. This was absolutely the best aspect of the course, as the open-ended nature allows you to create something you're passionate about and can put into your portfolio if you take it seriously. The grading on this project is also very forgiving, as ~90% is based solely on completion. Unfortunately, this means that if you choose to work in a group, some of your group members may not have the same level of commitment as you do. My advice is to take this project seriously because it's a great opportunity to build something you're passionate about that you can show off. Like the homework assignments, the project was a bit undermined by a complicated submission methodology which made it difficult to know whether or not you submitted successfully. Overall though, this was the best and most valuable part of the course, and in my opinion the only reason to take it at all. \n\nTECHNOLOGY REVIEW \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nThe technology review was a short paper in which you discuss some technology related to the content from the course. This was also very open-ended and was only graded based on completion. I actually liked this assignment, because it gave the opportunity to do some academic research; but the fact that it was very short and graded only on completion made it feel like a bit of an afterthought to justify the 4 credit hours and ultimately was busy work. We never received feedback of any sort for these, and it was merely a requirement to pass. Disappointing. \n\nCOURSE SUPPORT \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nThe management of this course by the course staff and the professor was abysmal and needs to be criticized heavily. Throughout the semester there was little to no communication regarding the due dates of assignments or assistance with any of the deliverables given the complicated submission methodology. The homework assignments in particular suffered heavily, as many of them were moved around or dropped completely; for the assignments that we did do, there were times where we had to resubmit or post in the Campuswire to confirm that we did them because of various glitches on the staff's side. All of this occurred with minimal communication despite pleas from the class on Campuswire for some clarity, and it was frankly unacceptable. The TA's and professor were unavailable on Campuswire and never responded to any emails. This level of mismanagement was absurd and significantly undermined the course as a whole.HelpfulEasyStrongly Disliked8 hrs/wk", "Text Information SystemsFall 2023linkA good overview, but very disorganized12/30/2023, 5:51 PMThis course gives a good overview of the subject, and grading is fairly generous.

The mps themselves were trivial and taught little, with one seeming to be an excuse for free labor on a research project.\n\nThe final project is open-ended and a nice way to apply some principles learned in class.

The lectures are a bit dated and not super exciting but easy enough to follow and the material was interesting. Exams were split, first one was rather difficult but second one was a breeze. The main issue with the course was the lack of communication there were multiple issues with MPs and due dates in general and the proff/TAs were radio silent at times which was frustrating.

One of them was literally just annotating websites, and the others were extremely thin \u2013 often required less than 5 lines of code to get full credit on.  Two of them required as little as changing just one variable. These assignments were not well designed or ready to be released, and they did not enhance the learning experience at all in my opinion.\n\nWeekly quizzes are very easy.  The questions are usually basic math problems or are simple facts that are blatantly on the lecture slides. The two exams were administered via ProctorU, and they were mostly the same as the quizzes but longer and maybe a tad more difficult. \n\nThe final project is extremely open ended and graded very leniently.\n\nThe redeeming quality of this class are the lectures, which are actually pretty good. I don't think many of the concepts are particularly difficult to understand, but the professor paced the lectures well and did a good job making them feel intuitive nonetheless.\n\nThis class took maybe 2-3 hours every week, excluding time consumed by the final project which took a bit longer. Overall, this is a pretty easy course and you will learn a decent amount about text information systems, but the assignments and course organization are unacceptably bad. \n\nIf you have an itch to learn about NLP, you may be tempted to take this class. I would HIGHLY recommend considering CS 447 instead.

That proved to be my experience as well.\n\nI had no TIS experience before, and ultimately I felt like I got my money's worth from the course through my introduction to core concepts like NLP, indexing, different models, etc.\n\nI found the lectures dull, and watching them each week felt like a chore compared to other courses. The MPs were manageable, but the \"data lab\" platform they are being run on feels like it's been neglected for too long.\n\nI'd still recommend this course as a good one to pair with another in the semester. Especially if you are new to TIS. I hope they invest some resources in refreshing this one - I think it could be really good.HelpfulMediumLiked10 hrs/wk", "Text Information SystemsFall 2022linkEasy but Informative Course12/19/2022, 4:21 PMThis course was a good intro to working with text data and what you can do with that data. Lots of NLP concepts. It's not super rigorous but it's good for introductions to important topics and algorithms.\n\nLectures:\n\nThe lectures were a bit dry but I liked them. Decent breadth of information, concepts conveyed clearly. There are 12 weeks total of lectures and each week takes about 2 hours. Maybe more if you need concepts solidified.\n\nQuizzes:\n\nOne for each lecture. If you watched the lecture and paid attention, these were very easy, and didn't take much time. There is also a practice quiz each week so you can see some of the types of questions you may be asked on the actual quiz.\n\nMPs\n\nThese were relatively simple projects with a complicated method of submission. There were \"4\" MPs (MP2 was split into 4 and one MP was dropped). I can't say I learned a ton from these, but you do get some exposure to good packages in Python that can be used later, including for the final project. MP1 was about tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming and implementing this in Python. MP2 was about building a corpus of documents, rating these documents on relevancy to a query, and using a ranking function to output results. The last part of MP2 was a little annoying as you were only supposed to tinker with parameter inputs until you got a result exceeding some benchmarks. I didn't like any of MP2 initially, but in retrospect, it was quite useful to see how you might design a search engine from start to finish and then rank your documents. Also provides insight in how you might build your own dataset. MP3 was probably the most difficult, but still not too bad. You implement the EM algorithm for PLSA. We were left in the dark for most the semester about whether there would be an MP4, and then they announced there would be one, but that the lowest MP score would be dropped. Since I had 100% up to that point, I didn't do it, but maybe it was a good one.\n\nTech Review:\n\nFor grad students/4 credit students, you needed to do a tech review, but it didn't factor in to your final percentage grade. Basically if you didn't do it you failed, if you did it your grade was based on all the other work in the class.\n\nI actually liked the tech review a lot. I was really groaning about it because I hate writing papers, but it was a review of some cutting edge technology in Text Mining/Retrieval/NLP architectures and it was really interesting learning about some of the technology and knowing enough about it to write the review. I was fascinated by how some of the general language models work.\n\nExams:\n\nProbably the hardest part of the course in terms of getting 100% on them. I didn't realize how much material there was until I studied for the exams. You could spend a ton of time studying for each. Luckily the first exam covers the first half of the class and the second covers the last half, so not comprehensive. A study sheet was posted for the second exam which helped a lot. I was worried going into these but I did quite well. I might have been slightly lucky though.\n\nFinal Project:\n\nA very important part of the class. If you put enough effort into it you can definitely use it for your portfolio, especially if it's something that can be expanded on and fine-tuned later. The project is quite open ended but has to be related to the concepts in the course. You will create an application/browser extension employing the concepts you choose that other students can install and use and evaluate. Think about it early. Come up with something good. You are meant to spend at least 20 hours individually on your project. Most people worked in groups, which is highly encouraged, but I worked alone. As I worked alone, I spent easily 60+ hours on it. I decided to make a web app out of it with basically 0 web app experience and no experience using APIs to gather data (which is actually very easy), so it was a grind with everything else I had going on but it was worth it. Without the final project I'd say this class is about 5 hours a week but the final project took tons of time in my final weeks. I used a lot of the stuff I had learned in the course, like ranking algorithms, tokenization, sentiment analysis (these were done with external libraries though, I didn't implement them myself, though I might for the sentiment analysis portion in the future).\n\nYou first form a team and choose a topic. About halfway through the semester you write a project proposal. A few weeks later you do a progress report. Then at the end you make a presentation describing how to install and run your project, with some examples of how it may be used, so others can do it from their devices. You also write full documentation about your project. Then after the deadline, you review several other projects, install them, use them, and provide feedback. A lot of these projects are being done by relative novices so installing them wasn't completely straightforward a lot of the time, so it took a while to review them. I saw lots of good ideas though. It was a lot of fun.\n\nProfessor and TAs:\n\nI really didn't need to rely on the professor or TAs too much so I can't say much about them. I know a lot of people trying to work ahead on the MPs were frustrated at times, but I only worked ahead on the lectures and quizzes (which are all available earlier on in the semester).\n\nMy background and circumstances:\n\nI took this class with PSL (my 3rd and 4th classes in the MCS program) and it was a lot of work to do both while working full time and taking a 3 week break in the middle for a wedding/honeymoon, but I got it done. This class was wayyyy less time consuming than PSL, except at the end with the project. A good class to take with another if you want.\n\nOverall, good class, not too difficult.

A lot of the workload is on the backend, if you actually put effort into the final project.\n\nFinal Project: I personally enjoyed my project, as it met the criterion of something novel, that was related to text processing. I reviewed 3 students final projects, two of which were plagiarized, unoriginal, and there was not a chance they met the minimum 20 hour threshold. That was disheartening. \n\nExams: Some of the verbiage on the exams was quite poor. Including a couple questions where a native speaker of English would see ambiguity and answer one way (and get it wrong). Additionally, I had no idea what I got wrong on Exam 1 ever. What's the point of taking exams if you're not going to get feedback?\n\nQuizzes: Listen to the lectures, use the course slides and your notes -> get a 100 on the quizzes.\n\nProjects: Some of the projects seemed like they were basically us grad students doing the leg work for a TAs thesis. For one of the projects the TAs uploaded the wrong test data to github and several people (including me) spent hours trying to reach a leaderboard threshold that was impossible. No apologies issued. The last project was a super vague one about solving a poorly documented algorithm. Oh, and then they added on an optional project at the end that could supplant the lowest grade. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. Projects overall were quite disorganized. Livedatalab was terrible.\n\nTech Review: I don't even know if anyone even looked at mine. It is ungraded.\n\nLectures: I thought the lectures were pretty well-organized and delivered.\n\nCommunication: I sent a couple messages to the TAs about my concern regarding a project meeting the threshold for originality, and I never got a response.

It's a great complement to other, maybe more challenging, fall semester classes (especially NLP - more below) and it does give you an appreciation for state-of-the-art text retrieval methods in industry. The final project is a fun chance to design or extend a real application using concepts from the course, which is probably a great interview talking point in front of any tech recruiter.\n\nThe cons - there are some really interesting concepts that are introduced, discussed at a high level, and dismissed relatively quickly because \"we don't have the time to go into this.\" Pretty surprising for a grad school course; more time should be spent diving into some of the more fundamental text retrieval & text mining concepts instead of piecing two related Coursera modules together and calling it a semester-long course. Concepts like Google's PageRank algorithm, the EM-algorithm, and BM-25 deserve a lot more attention - industry recruiters probably expect grad students coming out of this course to be experts in many of those concepts (and to be fair, those three concepts were covered the most heavily...but others, like MapReduce, are glossed over pretty significantly and there's no hands-on assignment to practice, only multiple-choice quizzes).\n\nAnother con - timed exams and ProctorU. This is a common problem and a major issue with any online-only program, including MCS, but ProctorU is a consistent headache. The actual exams in this course aren't bad at all, but getting through a ProctorU session without a technical/logistics hiccup is challenging at best. Advice to students who take this course in the future - sign up for an exam slot toward the end of the exam window, NOT in the first 1-2 days. Disappointing this is pretty much required, but you don't want to be the first student to uncover that the proctor doesn't actually know the password to unlock the exam (happened to me in this course) or that the proctor doesn't allow you to access materials that are explicitly allowed in the exam instructions (happened in another course last year), etc. etc.\n\nTook this course alongside CS 447 (Natural Language Processing) and the latter was far and away the better experience, even though the workload was higher and content was more challenging. For example, you implement four major concepts/algorithms in NLP, mostly using an industry-standard deep learning framework - PyTorch; in CS 410, by contrast, only one of the MPs really requires you to implement an algorithm by hand (the EM-algorithm). Even then, plenty of hints, docstrings, and Campuswire posts allow you to finish quickly without fully understanding how the pieces fit together.\n\nI'd take this again, especially if I didn't want to overburden myself with a heavy workload on top of another class, but it was a little disappointing to take NLP at the same time and see how great CS 410 *could have* been with greater depth on key concepts, better designed assignment logistics (someone please get rid of LiveDataLab), and an alternative to poorly-managed ProctorU exam sessions.HelpfulEasyNeutral6 hrs/wk", "Text Information SystemsFall 2022linkNice first course in the program!12/11/2022, 1:17 AMTo start off, I am an idiot.

Personally, I can also give it the designation of Highest Return on Effort out of the 3 classes I took in FA21.\n\nThe difficulty of the material is a Medium (though there is a single MP that takes more time than the others). If you put in regular weekly effort, all concepts can be acquired without dropping into TA office hours. Though reviewing Campuswire peer posts is extremely helpful to speed up grokking concepts and the TAs in FA21 were also very active on Campuswire.\n\nI study and work using a timer each day, so I reviewed my reports and saw that most weeks I spent around 10 hours on either content or code for the course. Some weeks I spent only 3 hours and one week went as high as 12.5 hours.\n\nAdditional resources to succeed in this course: take the audit version of the course, based on the syllabus appears to have an 80% overlap compared with the for-credit option. Also, there is a Anki flashcard deck (shout out to Matthew Mechtly for creating that deck with 360+ cards).\n\nQuizzes and Exams are straightforward and if you can answer all the quiz questions without hesitation, you do very well in the course.  Only a single MP requires more time with TA OH or Campuswire, the rest are very straightforward.\n\nThe above speaks to the effort required for the course. With regards to what you will take away or conceptual knowledge gained. I think the course description and annual course counseling introductions does a poor job of conveying the value and usage.\n\nThe idea of retrieving and ranking text-based results is obvious to anyone that has used a major internet search engine, search on a social-network or e-commerce website. With the knowledge and skills gained through this course, you will come to know all the knobs and levers to pull to adjust the performance of the search function for a given system.

I enjoyed the RegEx MP and Query language MP but the other MPs were a waste of time and you should know basic SQL and Pandas before taking any 500 level courses for Computer Science/Data Science. \n\nAlso this course covers a tool called YesWorkFlow for an entire week.  I wouldn't mind this being a bonus week of material but to have this included in a class that is very condensed and has a small amount of material, I think it is a waste.  \n\nYesWorkFlow being included is an example of this course not covering the most common data cleaning/quality tools that are available and used in the real-world.\n\nOverall this is an average easy course if you need one but if you are looking to learn a lot about this subject matter, there are mooc's that do a better job at this.HelpfulEasyNeutral3 hrs/wk", "Theory and Practice of Data CleaningSummer 2022linkEasy and informative course8/8/2022, 12:12 PMAs others have said, you get what you put into the course.

In my opinion, the course was very informative and was just as easy as all the other reviews state. \n\nThe course had no exams or quizzes. We had a total of six homework assignments of which you only had to complete five. The assignments also were not difficult and could be completed relatively quickly. The assignments deal with OpenRefine, Datalog, SQL, Python, and Workflows. \n\nWe also had one large data cleaning group project that was due at the end of the semester. The project was time consuming but did a nice job tying in all the topics discussed over the semester.\n\nSome reviews here say that you won't learn much but I disagree. You only get what you put into the course.

In summer 2022, there were 6 assignments, of which you only had to complete 5, in addition to a final group project. As someone who spends time cleaning data professionally, I did not find this course useful in the technical tools used or discussed (OpenRefine in particular). However, I did appreciate some of the taxonomy that the course provided to formalize ideas that were previously abstract ideals (data lineage and provenance).

This felt unfair to the groups who had scored well. So the instructor allowed the option to keep the previous grade or better it in the final submission.\nThis felt like good management and something I would not have expected any of my previous undergrad or grad class to do.\nOther than that, course content is good to learn, but some tools feel outdated and unclear if they'll be helpful in future.HelpfulVery EasyLiked5 hrs/wk", "Theory and Practice of Data CleaningSummer 2021linkImportant subject, light delivery12/16/2021, 8:41 AMThis course only touches on the surfaces of data cleaning as a 500 level course. Professor Bertram is fine as a lecturer, and the MPs and final project are reasonable. That said, this course would have been great if it goes into much more depth in each area of the data cleaning process, especially the theory side. I also wish the course to have mid term and final exams to help reinforce the learning, and it would have made another difference.HelpfulVery EasyNeutral3 hrs/wk", "Theory and Practice of Data CleaningSummer 2021linkYou get out what you put in9/3/2021, 1:45 PMThis is widely known as an easy class but does get a bit of bad rap. The material is extremely easy and the entire course could be completed over a long weekend. The project grading is extremely generous. \n\nHowever, if you watch the lectures and read the papers this class does introduce formalism to something I'd previous only approached as an ad-hoc necessary evil. In particular, at one point this class prompted me to take a deep dive into Answer Set Programming which led me down a rabbit hole (https://potassco.org/). \n\nThe professor is extremely available.

However, if I weren't also getting reimbursed for my tuition, my opinion might be different. Data Cleaning consisted of Jupyter notebooks and a final project. If you put your mind to it, you could probably finish the course in 2-3 weeks. I sat down one weekend and finished all of the notebooks.

The course starts off great with but kind of stalls after week3 . The assignments are repetitive and the tools used are not widely used in the industry. The optional assignment in Python has good potential  to be built on. Prof. needs to also publish the rubrics in one place and not all over campuswire, fireside chat, coursera etc. There is literally no theory in the theory and practice of cleaning which was also a let down.
